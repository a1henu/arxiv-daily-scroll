      "summary": "Video generation models nowadays are capable of generating visually realistic\nvideos, but often fail to adhere to physical laws, limiting their ability to\ngenerate physically plausible videos and serve as ''world models''. To address\nthis issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a\nrepresentation for guiding video generation models to enhance their\nphysics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task\nwhere the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the\ninput image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative\npositions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise\nPhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to\ninject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper\nsupervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance\nmotivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to\nphysical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation\nmodels to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization\n(DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for\nimproving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation,\nproving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging\nphysical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions\nfor various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement\nlearning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware\nvideo generation and broader applications."

Existing domain\nadaptation approaches finetune different VLM components, but this often results\nin limited domain-specific feature learning or catastrophic forgetting of prior\ncapabilities. To address these issues, we introduce Vision Contextualized\nProbing (VisCoP), which augments the VLM's vision encoder with a compact set of\nlearnable visual probes. These probes enable efficient domain-specific\nadaptation with minimal modification to pretrained parameters. We evaluate\nVisCoP across three challenging domain adaptation settings-cross-view\n(exocentric to egocentric), cross-modal (RGB to depth), and cross-task (human\nunderstanding to robot control). Experiments show that VisCoP consistently\noutperforms existing adaptation strategies, achieving superior performance on\ntarget domains while effectively retaining source-domain knowledge."

This deficiency is\nmanifested either in poor performance on grounding or in an excessive reliance\non external modules, ultimately hindering the seamless integration of grounding\nand spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective\ndual-path pooling mechanism that tightly aligns geometric features with both\nsemantic and positional cues, constructing a unified image patch-based 3D\nrepresentation that encapsulates all essential information without increasing\nthe number of input tokens. Leveraging this holistic representation,\nGS-Reasoner is the first 3D LLM that achieves autoregressive grounding entirely\nwithout external modules while delivering performance comparable to\nstate-of-the-art models, establishing a unified and self-contained framework\nfor 3D spatial reasoning. To further bridge grounding and spatial reasoning, we\nintroduce the Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) dataset. This dataset is\nmeticulously curated to include both 3D bounding box annotations for objects\nreferenced in reasoning questions and step-by-step reasoning paths that\nintegrate grounding as a core component of the problem-solving process.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that GS-Reasoner achieves impressive results\non 3D visual grounding, which in turn significantly enhances its spatial\nreasoning capabilities, leading to state-of-the-art performance."

Recent\nwork has shown preliminary evidence that grounding may emerge in\n(vision-)language models trained at scale without using explicit grounding\nobjectives. Yet, the specific loci of this emergence and the mechanisms that\ndrive it remain largely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce a\ncontrolled evaluation framework that systematically traces how symbol grounding\narises within the internal computations through mechanistic and causal\nanalysis. Our findings show that grounding concentrates in middle-layer\ncomputations and is implemented through the aggregate mechanism, where\nattention heads aggregate the environmental ground to support the prediction of\nlinguistic forms. This phenomenon replicates in multimodal dialogue and across\narchitectures (Transformers and state-space models), but not in unidirectional\nLSTMs. Our results provide behavioral and mechanistic evidence that symbol\ngrounding can emerge in language models, with practical implications for\npredicting and potentially controlling the reliability of generation."

Existing open-source datasets are often\nplagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data,\nsuch as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model\ncapabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary\ncontributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising\napproximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning\ntechniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment\nstrategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its\nunderlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and\nadaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset\nreleases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B\nmodel on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is\ncompetitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as\nInternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational\nresources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite\ncomprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness;\nand the model weights.

This\nchallenge is particularly important when model owners keep their models private\nand may be unwilling or unable to handle authorship issues, making third-party\nverification essential. A natural solution is to embed watermarks for later\nverification. However, existing methods require access to model weights and\nrely on computationally heavy procedures, rendering them impractical and\nnon-scalable. To address these challenges, we propose , a lightweight\nwatermarking scheme that utilizes the random seed used to initialize the\ndiffusion process as a proof of authorship without modifying the generation\nprocess. Our key observation is that the initial noise derived from a seed is\nhighly correlated with the generated visual content. By incorporating a hash\nfunction into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a\nvalid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an\nalternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the\nrobustness of our method under various manipulations. Finally, we show how to\nuse cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to prove ownership without revealing\nthe seed. By keeping the seed secret, we increase the difficulty of watermark\nremoval. In our experiments, we validate NoisePrints on multiple\nstate-of-the-art diffusion models for images and videos, demonstrating\nefficient verification using only the seed and output, without requiring access\nto model weights."

In this work, we introduce AVC (Adaptive Visual\nConditioning), a framework for diffusion-based story continuation. AVC employs\nthe CLIP model to retrieve the most semantically aligned image from previous\nframes. Crucially, when no sufficiently relevant image is found, AVC adaptively\nrestricts the influence of prior visuals to only the early stages of the\ndiffusion process. This enables the model to exploit visual context when\nbeneficial, while avoiding the injection of misleading or irrelevant\ninformation. Furthermore, we improve data quality by re-captioning a noisy\ndataset using large language models, thereby strengthening textual supervision\nand semantic alignment. Quantitative results and human evaluations demonstrate\nthat AVC achieves superior coherence, semantic consistency, and visual fidelity\ncompared to strong baselines, particularly in challenging cases where prior\nvisuals conflict with the current input."

Its core idea is spatially guided\nvision-language-action training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical\nlink between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage\npipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning\ndata to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual,\nembodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training\nto decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through\nplug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields\nconsistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance\nby +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO\nFranka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box,\npoint, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built a\nsimulation engine to collect 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes,\nenabling a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In\nreal-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with\nsynthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel\nconfigurations.

Notably, InteractiveOmni-4B\nis comparable to the much larger model like Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on general\nbenchmarks, and it can retain 97% of the performance of the InteractiveOmni-8B\nwhile utilizing only 50% of the model size. Achieving state-of-the-art results\nagainst similarly sized models across image, audio, video understanding, and\nspeech generation tasks, InteractiveOmni is an accessible, open-source\nfoundation for next-generation intelligent interactive systems."

We introduce\n\\textbf{UniCalli}, a unified diffusion framework for column-level recognition\nand generation. Training both tasks jointly is deliberate: recognition\nconstrains the generator to preserve character structure, while generation\nprovides style and layout priors. This synergy fosters concept-level\nabstractions that improve both tasks, especially in limited-data regimes. We\ncurated a dataset of over 8,000 digitized pieces, with ~4,000 densely\nannotated. UniCalli employs asymmetric noising and a rasterized box map for\nspatial priors, trained on a mix of synthetic, labeled, and unlabeled data. The\nmodel achieves state-of-the-art generative quality with superior ligature\ncontinuity and layout fidelity, alongside stronger recognition. The framework\nsuccessfully extends to other ancient scripts, including Oracle bone\ninscriptions and Egyptian hieroglyphs.

Low-field MRI is cheaper, more accessible, and safer, but suffers\nfrom low resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This synthesis process can\nreduce reliance on costly acquisitions and expand data availability. However,\nsynthesizing high-field MRI still suffers from a clinical fidelity gap. There\nis a need to preserve anatomical fidelity, enhance fine-grained structural\ndetails, and bridge domain gaps in image contrast. To address these issues, we\npropose a \\emph{cyclic self-supervised diffusion (CSS-Diff)} framework for\nhigh-field MRI synthesis from real low-field MRI data. Our core idea is to\nreformulate diffusion-based synthesis under a cycle-consistent constraint. It\nenforces anatomical preservation throughout the generative process rather than\njust relying on paired pixel-level supervision. The CSS-Diff framework further\nincorporates two novel processes. The slice-wise gap perception network aligns\ninter-slice inconsistencies via contrastive learning. The local structure\ncorrection network enhances local feature restoration through\nself-reconstruction of masked and perturbed patches. Extensive experiments on\ncross-field synthesis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,\nachieving state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 31.80 $\\pm$ 2.70 dB in PSNR,\n0.943 $\\pm$ 0.102 in SSIM, and 0.0864 $\\pm$ 0.0689 in LPIPS).

To address these challenges, we used a\nthinning-based skeletonization algorithm to extract and curate centerline\ngraphs and morphometric features from the TopCoW dataset, which includes 200\nstroke patients, each imaged with MRA and CTA. The curated graphs were used to\ndevelop a baseline algorithm for centerline and feature extraction, combining\nU-Net-based skeletonization with A* graph connection. Performance was evaluated\non a held-out test set, focusing on anatomical accuracy and feature robustness.\nFurther, we used the extracted features to predict the frequency of fetal PCA\nvariants, confirm theoretical bifurcation optimality relations, and detect\nsubtle modality differences. The baseline algorithm consistently reconstructed\ngraph topology with high accuracy (F1 = 1), and the average Euclidean node\ndistance between reference and predicted graphs was below one voxel. Features\nsuch as segment radius, length, and bifurcation ratios showed strong\nrobustness, with median relative errors below 5% and Pearson correlations above\n0.95.

Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)\nhave become popular methods for generating healthy counterfactuals of pathology\ndata.

To solve this problem, we\npropose a novel application of denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) -\nwhich, unlike DDPMs, condition the diffusion process not only on the initial\npoint (i.e., the healthy image), but also on the final point (i.e., a\ncorresponding synthetically generated pathological image). Treating the\npathological image as a structurally informative prior enables us to generate\ncounterfactuals that closely match the patient's anatomy while selectively\nremoving pathology.

However, video MAR models\nsuffer from two major limitations: the slow-start problem, caused by the lack\nof a structured global prior at early sampling stages, and error accumulation\nacross the autoregression in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this\nwork, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues\nby introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next\nframe, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides\nglobal structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame\nsynthesis. Furthermore, we introduce compositional classifier-free guidance\nthat jointly enlarges spatial (canvas) and temporal conditioning, and employ\nnoise-based canvas augmentation to enhance robustness. Experiments on the BAIR\nand Kinetics-600 benchmarks demonstrate that CanvasMAR produces high-quality\nvideos with fewer autoregressive steps. Our approach achieves remarkable\nperformance among autoregressive models on Kinetics-600 dataset and rivals\ndiffusion-based methods."

In this work, we present OmniGaze, a\nsemi-supervised framework for 3D gaze estimation, which utilizes large-scale\nunlabeled data collected from diverse and unconstrained real-world environments\nto mitigate domain bias and generalize gaze estimation in the wild. First, we\nbuild a diverse collection of unlabeled facial images, varying in facial\nappearances, background environments, illumination conditions, head poses, and\neye occlusions. In order to leverage unlabeled data spanning a broader\ndistribution, OmniGaze adopts a standard pseudo-labeling strategy and devises a\nreward model to assess the reliability of pseudo labels. Beyond pseudo labels\nas 3D direction vectors, the reward model also incorporates visual embeddings\nextracted by an off-the-shelf visual encoder and semantic cues from gaze\nperspective generated by prompting a Multimodal Large Language Model to compute\nconfidence scores. Then, these scores are utilized to select high-quality\npseudo labels and weight them for loss computation. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that OmniGaze achieves state-of-the-art performance on five\ndatasets under both in-domain and cross-domain settings.

Building on AnomalyDINO, a\ntraining-free deep nearest-neighbor detector over DINOv2 features, we present\none of the first systematic studies of adversarial attacks and uncertainty\nestimation in this setting. To enable white-box gradient attacks while\npreserving test-time behavior, we attach a lightweight linear head to frozen\nDINOv2 features only for crafting perturbations. Using this heuristic, we\nevaluate the impact of FGSM across the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets and observe\nconsistent drops in F1, AUROC, AP, and G-mean, indicating that imperceptible\nperturbations can flip nearest-neighbor relations in feature space to induce\nconfident misclassification. Complementing robustness, we probe reliability and\nfind that raw anomaly scores are poorly calibrated, revealing a gap between\nconfidence and correctness that limits safety-critical use. As a simple, strong\nbaseline toward trustworthiness, we apply post-hoc Platt scaling to the anomaly\nscores for uncertainty estimation. The resulting calibrated posteriors yield\nsignificantly higher predictive entropy on adversarially perturbed inputs than\non clean ones, enabling a practical flagging mechanism for attack detection\nwhile reducing calibration error (ECE). Our findings surface concrete\nvulnerabilities in DINOv2-based few-shot anomaly detectors and establish an\nevaluation protocol and baseline for robust, uncertainty-aware anomaly\ndetection.

However, most existing approaches rely solely on\nvisual data, making them unreliable under challenging conditions such as\nocclusion, low illumination, and adverse weather. Moreover, the absence of\nlarge-scale synchronized audio-visual datasets has hindered progress in\nmultimodal anomaly recognition. To address these limitations, this study\npresents AVAR-Net, a lightweight and efficient audio-visual anomaly recognition\nframework designed for real-world environments. AVAR-Net consists of four main\nmodules: an audio feature extractor, a video feature extractor, fusion\nstrategy, and a sequential pattern learning network that models cross-modal\nrelationships for anomaly recognition. Specifically, the Wav2Vec2 model\nextracts robust temporal features from raw audio, while MobileViT captures both\nlocal and global visual representations from video frames. An early fusion\nmechanism combines these modalities, and a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional\nNetwork (MTCN) model that learns long-range temporal dependencies within the\nfused representation, enabling robust spatiotemporal reasoning. A novel\nVisual-Audio Anomaly Recognition (VAAR) dataset, is also introduced, serving as\na medium-scale benchmark containing 3,000 real-world videos with synchronized\naudio across ten diverse anomaly classes. Experimental evaluations demonstrate\nthat AVAR-Net achieves 89.29% accuracy on VAAR and 88.56% Average Precision on\nthe XD-Violence dataset, improving Average Precision by 2.8% over existing\nstate-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness,\nefficiency, and generalization capability of the proposed framework, as well as\nthe utility of VAAR as a benchmark for advancing multimodal anomaly recognition\nresearch."

We introduce an\nagent-based, streaming benchmark that reveals how cross-cultural composition\nand progressive blurring interact to shape face recognition robustness. Each\nagent operates in a frozen CLIP feature space with a lightweight residual\nadapter trained online at sigma=0 and fixed during testing. Agents move and\ninteract on a 5x5 lattice, while the environment provides inputs with\nsigma-scheduled Gaussian blur. We examine monocultural populations\n(Western-only, Asian-only) and mixed environments with balanced (5/5) and\nimbalanced (8/2, 2/8) compositions, as well as different spatial contact\nstructures. Results show clear asymmetric degradation curves between cultural\ngroups: JAFFE (Asian) populations maintain higher performance at low blur but\nexhibit sharper drops at intermediate stages, whereas KDEF (Western)\npopulations degrade more uniformly. Mixed populations exhibit intermediate\npatterns, with balanced mixtures mitigating early degradation, but imbalanced\nsettings amplify majority-group weaknesses under high blur.

The original Hoecken linkage is reconfigured by replacing one member\nwith differential links, preserving straight-line guidance while enabling\ncontact-triggered reconfiguration without additional actuators. A\ndouble-parallelogram arrangement maintains fingertip parallelism during\nconventional pinching, whereas the differential mechanism allows one finger to\nwrap inward upon encountering an obstacle, improving stability on irregular or\nthin objects. The mechanism can be driven by a single linear actuator,\nminimizing complexity and cost; in our prototype, each finger is driven by its\nown linear actuator for simplicity. We perform kinematic modeling and force\nanalysis to characterize grasp performance, including simulated grasping forces\nand spring-opening behavior under varying geometric parameters. The design was\nprototyped using PLA-based 3D printing, achieving a linear pinching span of\napproximately 200 mm. Preliminary tests demonstrate reliable grasping in both\nmodes across a wide range of object geometries, highlighting the Hoecken-D Hand\nas a compact, adaptable, and cost-effective solution for manipulation in\nunstructured environments."

This paper presents the first\nstudy of hardware-accelerated feature detectors considering a Visual SLAM\n(V-SLAM) pipeline. We offer new insights by comparing the best GPU-accelerated\nFAST, Harris, and SuperPoint implementations against the FPGA-accelerated\ncounterparts on modern SoCs (Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal).\n  The evaluation shows that when using a non-learning-based feature detector\nsuch as FAST and Harris, their GPU implementations, and the GPU-accelerated\nV-SLAM can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency than the\nFAST and Harris FPGA implementations as well as the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM.\nHowever, when considering a learning-based detector such as SuperPoint, its\nFPGA implementation can achieve better run-time performance and energy\nefficiency (up to 3.1$\\times$ and 1.4$\\times$ improvements, respectively) than\nthe GPU implementation. The FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM can also achieve comparable\nrun-time performance compared to the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM, with better FPS in\n2 out of 5 dataset sequences. When considering the accuracy, the results show\nthat the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM is more accurate than the FPGA-accelerated\nV-SLAM in general.

In\ncontrast to widely used, commercially available yet prohibitively expensive 3D\nbreast scanning solutions and existing low-cost alternatives, our method\nrequires neither specialized hardware nor proprietary software and can be used\nwith any device that is able to record RGB videos. The key building blocks of\nour pipeline are a state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf Structure-from-motion\npipeline, paired with a parametric breast model for robust and metrically\ncorrect surface reconstruction. Our model, similarly to the recently proposed\nimplicit Regensburg Breast Shape Model (iRBSM), leverages implicit neural\nrepresentations to model breast shapes. However, unlike the iRBSM, which\nemploys a single global neural signed distance function (SDF), our approach --\ninspired by recent state-of-the-art face models -- decomposes the implicit\nbreast domain into multiple smaller regions, each represented by a local neural\nSDF anchored at anatomical landmark positions. When incorporated into our\nsurface reconstruction pipeline, the proposed model, dubbed liRBSM (short for\nlocalized iRBSM), significantly outperforms the iRBSM in terms of\nreconstruction quality, yielding more detailed surface reconstruction than its\nglobal counterpart. Overall, we find that the introduced pipeline is able to\nrecover high-quality 3D breast geometry within an error margin of less than 2\nmm.

To realize collaborative\nperception in actual heterogeneous scenarios, existing methods usually align\nneighbor features to those of the ego vehicle, which is vulnerable to noise\nfrom domain gaps and thus fails to address feature discrepancies effectively.\nMoreover, they adopt transformer-based modules for domain adaptation, which\ncauses the model inference inefficiency on mobile devices. To tackle these\nissues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages\nDomain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios.\nThe CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight\nSpatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation\n(DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI)\nloss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the\nneighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight\nconvolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution\ndiscrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation\nmodules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter\ncaptures task-related information. During training, the DAMI loss maximizes the\nmutual information between aligned heterogeneous features to enhance the domain\nseparation process. The CoDS employs a fully convolutional architecture, which\nensures high inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the\nCoDS effectively mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios and\nachieves a trade-off between detection accuracy and inference efficiency."

Unlike existing methods limited\nto lower resolutions, our approach achieves 4K+ resolution while maintaining\nprecise content consistency and prompt alignment, two critical challenges in\nimage inpainting that intensify with increasing resolution and texture\ncomplexity. Patch-Adapter leverages a two-stage adapter architecture to scale\nthe diffusion model's resolution from 1K to 4K+ without requiring structural\noverhauls: (1) Dual Context Adapter learns coherence between masked and\nunmasked regions at reduced resolutions to establish global structural\nconsistency; and (2) Reference Patch Adapter implements a patch-level attention\nmechanism for full-resolution inpainting, preserving local detail fidelity\nthrough adaptive feature fusion. This dual-stage architecture uniquely\naddresses the scalability gap in high-resolution inpainting by decoupling\nglobal semantics from localized refinement. Experiments demonstrate that\nPatch-Adapter not only resolves artifacts common in large-scale inpainting but\nalso achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenImages and\nPhoto-Concept-Bucket datasets, outperforming existing methods in both\nperceptual quality and text-prompt adherence."

However, existing methods often suffer from limited\ngeneralization and semantic expressiveness due to the domain-sensitive nature\nof Channel State Information and the lack of high-level gesture abstraction. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel generalization framework, termed\nLarge-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment (GLSDA), which leverages\nthe semantic prior of pre-trained large foundation models to enhance gesture\nrepresentation learning in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.\nSpecifically, we first design a dual-path CSI encoding pipeline that captures\ngeometric and dynamic gesture patterns via CSI-Ratio phase sequences and\nDoppler spectrograms. These representations are then fed into a Multiscale\nSemantic Encoder, which learns robust temporal embeddings and aligns them with\ngesture semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. To further enhance\ncategory discrimination, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Soft Supervision scheme\nthat encodes inter-class correlations and reduces label ambiguity, especially\nfor semantically similar gestures. Finally, we develop a Robust\nDual-Distillation strategy to compress the aligned model into a lightweight\nstudent network, jointly distilling intermediate features and semantic-informed\nsoft labels from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the Widar3.0\nbenchmark show that GLSDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in\nboth in-domain and cross-domain gesture recognition tasks, while significantly\nreducing model size and inference latency.

      "summary": "Structure-from-Motion (SfM), a method that recovers camera poses and scene\ngeometry from uncalibrated images, is a central component in robotic\nreconstruction and simulation. Despite the state-of-the-art performance of\ntraditional SfM methods such as COLMAP and its follow-up work, GLOMAP, naive\nCPU-specialized implementations of bundle adjustment (BA) or global positioning\n(GP) introduce significant computational overhead when handling large-scale\nscenarios, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and speed in SfM. Moreover,\nthe blessing of efficient C++-based implementations in COLMAP and GLOMAP comes\nwith the curse of limited flexibility, as they lack support for various\nexternal optimization options. On the other hand, while deep learning based SfM\npipelines like VGGSfM and VGGT enable feed-forward 3D reconstruction, they are\nunable to scale to thousands of input views at once as GPU memory consumption\nincreases sharply as the number of input views grows. In this paper, we unleash\nthe full potential of GPU parallel computation to accelerate each critical\nstage of the standard SfM pipeline. Building upon recent advances in\nsparse-aware bundle adjustment optimization, our design extends these\ntechniques to accelerate both BA and GP within a unified global SfM framework.\nThrough extensive experiments on datasets of varying scales (e.g. 5000 images\nwhere VGGSfM and VGGT run out of memory), our method demonstrates up to about\n40 times speedup over COLMAP while achieving consistently comparable or even\nimproved reconstruction accuracy.

The key to this task\nis to setup the exact correlations between the point representations and their\nbase class labels, as well as the representation correlations between the\npoints from base and novel classes. A coarse or statistical correlation\nlearning may lead to the confusion in novel class inference. lf we impose a\ncausal relationship as a strong correlated constraint upon the learning\nprocess, the essential point cloud representations that accurately correspond\nto the classes should be uncovered. To this end, we introduce a structural\ncausal model (SCM) to re-formalize the 3D-NCD problem and propose a new method,\ni.e., Joint Learning of Causal Representation and Reasoning. Specifically, we\nfirst analyze hidden confounders in the base class representations and the\ncausal relationships between the base and novel classes through SCM. We devise\na causal representation prototype that eliminates confounders to capture the\ncausal representations of base classes. A graph structure is then used to model\nthe causal relationships between the base classes' causal representation\nprototypes and the novel class prototypes, enabling causal reasoning from base\nto novel classes.

Unlike\nconventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the\nimage as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the\nimage reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes\nan encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked\nlow-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to\nidentify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to\nreconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the\npre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive\nlearning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration\ntasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained\nencoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve\noutstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves\nperformance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with\na minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and\na 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation\nscenarios.

Firstly, large convolution\nkernels in the stem network are used to enlarge the receptive field, which\neffectively extracts detailed head information.

Experiments on three benchmarks show that our network is suitable for\nsuper real-time crowd counting on embedded systems, ensuring competitive\naccuracy.

In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to\ndifferent VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model\narchitecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these\npatches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual\nlatent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent\nrepresentations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs.\nThrough the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's\ninterpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate\nincorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given\nrobotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for\nthe visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent\nrepresentations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs.\nExtensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation\nbenchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate\nof cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates\nthis degradation.

However, despite rapid progress, their conceptual boundaries remain\nblurred, as VP and VPT are frequently used interchangeably in current research,\nreflecting a lack of systematic distinction between these techniques and their\nrespective applications. In this survey, we revisit the designs of VP and VPT\nfrom first principles, and conceptualize them within a unified framework termed\nPrompt-based Adaptation (PA). We provide a taxonomy that categorizes existing\nmethods into learnable, generative, and non-learnable prompts, and further\norganizes them by injection granularity -- pixel-level and token-level. Beyond\nthe core methodologies, we examine PA's integrations across diverse domains,\nincluding medical imaging, 3D point clouds, and vision-language tasks, as well\nas its role in test-time adaptation and trustworthy AI. We also summarize\ncurrent benchmarks and identify key challenges and future directions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, we are the first comprehensive survey dedicated to PA's\nmethodologies and applications in light of their distinct characteristics.

Unlike traditional edge resource management methods that\nemphasize communication throughput or general-purpose learning performance, EGS\nexplicitly aims to maximize the GS qualities, rendering existing approaches\ninapplicable. To address this problem, this paper formulates a novel\nGS-oriented objective function that distinguishes the heterogeneous view\ncontributions of different clients. However, evaluating this function in turn\nrequires clients' images, leading to a causality dilemma. To this end, this\npaper further proposes a sample-then-transmit EGS (or STT-GS for short)\nstrategy, which first samples a subset of images as pilot data from each client\nfor loss prediction. Based on the first-stage evaluation, communication\nresources are then prioritized towards more valuable clients. To achieve\nefficient sampling, a feature-domain clustering (FDC) scheme is proposed to\nselect the most representative data and pilot transmission time minimization\n(PTTM) is adopted to reduce the pilot overhead.Subsequently, we develop a joint\nclient selection and power control (JCSPC) framework to maximize the\nGS-oriented function under communication resource constraints. Despite the\nnonconvexity of the problem, we propose a low-complexity efficient solution\nbased on the penalty alternating majorization minimization (PAMM) algorithm.\nExperiments unveil that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing\nbenchmarks on real-world datasets.

While\nrecent deep learning-based denoising models have shown strong performance,\nthese models are mostly trained on simulated or single real-world scenario\ndata, overlooking the significant differences in noise characteristics from\ndifferent geographical regions. Intuitively, models trained in one environment\noften struggle to perform well in new settings due to differences in geological\nconditions, equipment, and external interference, leading to reduced denoising\nperformance. To this end, we propose the Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization\nTest-time Adaptation (DP-TTA). Our key insight is that TEM signals possess\nintrinsic physical characteristics, such as exponential decay and smoothness,\nwhich remain consistent across different regions regardless of external\nconditions. These intrinsic characteristics serve as ideal prior knowledge for\nguiding the TTA strategy, which helps the pre-trained model dynamically adjust\nparameters by utilizing self-supervised losses, improving denoising performance\nin new scenarios. To implement this, we customized a network, named DTEMDNet.\nSpecifically, we first use dictionary learning to encode these intrinsic\ncharacteristics as a dictionary-driven prior, which is integrated into the\nmodel during training. At the testing stage, this prior guides the model to\nadapt dynamically to new environments by minimizing self-supervised losses\nderived from the dictionary-driven consistency and the signal one-order\nvariation.

By analogy, the information entropy\nof the text modality relative to the visual modality is increased; 2) A\nhypergraph adapter is used to construct multilateral connections between the\ntext and image modalities, which can correct the positive and negative matching\nerrors for synonymous semantics in the same fixed embedding space, whilst\nreducing the noise caused by open semantic entropy by mapping the reduced\ndimensions back to the original dimensions.

      "summary": "Deep learning models for medical image segmentation often struggle when\ndeployed across different datasets due to domain shifts - variations in both\nimage appearance, known as style, and population-dependent anatomical\ncharacteristics, referred to as content. This paper presents a novel\nunsupervised domain adaptation framework that directly addresses domain shifts\nencountered in cross-domain hippocampus segmentation from MRI, with specific\nemphasis on content variations. Our approach combines efficient style\nharmonisation through z-normalisation with a bidirectional deformable image\nregistration (DIR) strategy. The DIR network is jointly trained with\nsegmentation and discriminator networks to guide the registration with respect\nto a region of interest and generate anatomically plausible transformations\nthat align source images to the target domain. We validate our approach through\ncomprehensive evaluations on both a synthetic dataset using Morpho-MNIST (for\ncontrolled validation of core principles) and three MRI hippocampus datasets\nrepresenting populations with varying degrees of atrophy. Across all\nexperiments, our method outperforms existing baselines. For hippocampus\nsegmentation, when transferring from young, healthy populations to clinical\ndementia patients, our framework achieves up to 15% relative improvement in\nDice score compared to standard augmentation methods, with the largest gains\nobserved in scenarios with substantial content shift. These results highlight\nthe efficacy of our approach for accurate hippocampus segmentation across\ndiverse populations."

Most\nlearning-based approaches train with a combination of structural similarity\nloss, intensity reconstruction loss, and a gradient-magnitude term. However,\ncollapsing gradients to their magnitude removes directional information,\nyielding ambiguous supervision and suboptimal edge fidelity. We introduce a\ndirection-aware, multi-scale gradient loss that supervises horizontal and\nvertical components separately and preserves their sign across scales. This\naxis-wise, sign-preserving objective provides clear directional guidance at\nboth fine and coarse resolutions, promoting sharper, better-aligned edges and\nricher texture preservation without changing model architectures or training\nprotocols. Experiments on open-source model and multiple public benchmarks\ndemonstrate effectiveness of our approach."

      "summary": "In this paper, we identify that the key criterion for determining whether a\nmodel is truly capable of novel view synthesis (NVS) is transferability:\nWhether any pose representation extracted from one video sequence can be used\nto re-render the same camera trajectory in another. We analyze prior work on\nself-supervised NVS and find that their predicted poses do not transfer: The\nsame set of poses lead to different camera trajectories in different 3D scenes.\nHere, we present XFactor, the first geometry-free self-supervised model capable\nof true NVS. XFactor combines pair-wise pose estimation with a simple\naugmentation scheme of the inputs and outputs that jointly enables\ndisentangling camera pose from scene content and facilitates geometric\nreasoning. Remarkably, we show that XFactor achieves transferability with\nunconstrained latent pose variables, without any 3D inductive biases or\nconcepts from multi-view geometry -- such as an explicit parameterization of\nposes as elements of SE(3). We introduce a new metric to quantify\ntransferability, and through large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that\nXFactor significantly outperforms prior pose-free NVS transformers, and show\nthat latent poses are highly correlated with real-world poses through probing\nexperiments."

      "summary": "Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) hold immense promise for enabling\ngeneralist robot manipulation. However, the best way to build them remains an\nopen question. Current approaches often add complexity, such as modifying the\nexisting vocabulary of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with action tokens or\nintroducing special action heads. Curiously, the simplest strategy of\nrepresenting actions directly as text has remained largely unexplored. This\nwork introduces VLA-0 to investigate this idea. We find that VLA-0 is not only\neffective; it is surprisingly powerful. With the right design, VLA-0\noutperforms more involved models. On LIBERO, a popular benchmark for evaluating\nVLAs, VLA-0 outperforms all existing methods trained on the same robotic data,\nincluding $\\pi_0.5$-KI, OpenVLA-OFT and SmolVLA. Furthermore, without\nlarge-scale robotics-specific training, it outperforms methods trained on\nlarge-scale robotic data, like $\\pi_0.5$-KI, $\\pi_0$, GR00T-N1 and MolmoAct.\nThese findings also translate to the real world, where VLA-0 outperforms\nSmolVLA, a VLA model pre-trained on large-scale real data. This paper\nsummarizes our unexpected findings and spells out the specific techniques\nrequired to unlock the high performance of this simple yet potent VLA design.\nVisual results, code, and trained models are provided here:\nhttps://vla0.github.io/."
