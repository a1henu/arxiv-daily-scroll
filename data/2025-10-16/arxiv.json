      "summary": "We present an inference-time diffusion sampling method to perform multi-view\nconsistent image editing using pre-trained 2D image editing models. These\nmodels can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of\nmulti-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency\nacross views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over\nexplicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization\nprocess and instability under sparse view settings. We propose an implicit 3D\nregularization approach by constraining the generated 2D image sequences to\nadhere to a pre-trained multi-view image distribution. This is achieved through\ncoupled diffusion sampling, a simple diffusion sampling technique that\nconcurrently samples two trajectories from both a multi-view image distribution\nand a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce the\nmulti-view consistency among the generated images. We validate the\neffectiveness and generality of this framework on three distinct multi-view\nimage editing tasks, demonstrating its applicability across various model\narchitectures and highlighting its potential as a general solution for\nmulti-view consistent editing."

Yet, two lingering clouds cast shadows over its widespread\nexploration and promotion: (-) What fundamental constraints set native VLMs\napart from modular ones, and to what extent can these barriers be overcome? (-)\nHow to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby\naccelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges\nand outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one\nnative VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word\nrepresentations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the\nstrengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently\nembody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language\nencoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of\nnative VLMs built from first principles, capable of rivaling top-tier modular\ncounterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With only 390M image-text\nexamples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while\nmitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model\ncrafted from our elaborate primitives. We position NEO as a cornerstone for\nscalable and powerful native VLMs, paired with a rich set of reusable\ncomponents that foster a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem.

For each\ninput and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the\ninstruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for\nend-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution\nmatching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the\nimage manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard\nbenchmarks and include an extensive ablation study.

In this paper, we present\nTerra, a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable\nenvironments in an intrinsic 3D latent space. Specifically, we propose a novel\npoint-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into\na latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian\nprimitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse\npoint flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point\nrepresentation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the\npoint latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D\nrepresentation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any\nviewpoint with only a single generation process. Furthermore, Terra achieves\nexplorable world modeling through progressive generation in the point latent\nspace. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging indoor scenes from\nScanNet v2.

This reliance often leads to\na failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the\nreference face rather than preserving identity across natural variations in\npose, expression, or lighting. Such over-similarity undermines controllability\nand limits the expressive power of generation. To address these limitations, we\n(1) construct a large-scale paired dataset MultiID-2M, tailored for\nmulti-person scenarios, providing diverse references for each identity; (2)\nintroduce a benchmark that quantifies both copy-paste artifacts and the\ntrade-off between identity fidelity and variation; and (3) propose a novel\ntraining paradigm with a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data\nto balance fidelity with diversity.

However, this multi-stage process is\nprone to cumulative errors, introduces high latency, and yields weak coupling\nbetween semantics and control. These limitations call for a more direct pathway\nfrom language to action, one that eliminates fragile intermediate stages.\nTherefore, we present RoboGhost, a retargeting-free framework that directly\nconditions humanoid policies on language-grounded motion latents.

A hybrid causal\ntransformer-diffusion motion generator further ensures long-horizon consistency\nwhile maintaining stability and diversity, yielding rich latent representations\nfor precise humanoid behavior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboGhost\nsubstantially reduces deployment latency, improves success rates and tracking\naccuracy, and produces smooth, semantically aligned locomotion on real\nhumanoids.

To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our\nnewly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static\nscene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then\nbe projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped\nviews that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to\nevolve naturally from temporal context.

Yet, they remain highly susceptible to\nadversarial perturbations and targeted backdoor attacks. Mitigating such\nvulnerabilities remains an open challenge, especially given that the\nlarge-scale nature of the models prohibits retraining to ensure safety.\nExisting backdoor removal approaches rely on costly fine-tuning to override the\nharmful behavior, and can often degrade performance on other unrelated tasks.\nThis raises the question of whether backdoors can be removed without\ncompromising the general capabilities of the models. In this work, we address\nthis question and study how backdoors are encoded in the model weight space,\nfinding that they are disentangled from other benign tasks. Specifically, this\nseparation enables the isolation and erasure of the backdoor's influence on the\nmodel with minimal impact on clean performance. Building on this insight, we\nintroduce a simple unlearning method that leverages such disentanglement.\nThrough extensive experiments with CLIP-based models and common adversarial\ntriggers, we show that, given the knowledge of the attack, our method achieves\napproximately perfect unlearning, while retaining, on average, 96% of clean\naccuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that even when the attack and its\npresence are unknown, our method successfully unlearns backdoors by proper\nestimation using reverse-engineered triggers.

For BERT-style encoders,\nvarious studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective\nthan discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language\nmodels (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts\n''yes'' (resp.

In\nthis work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and\nSFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the\nexperimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components:\nweight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which\nguides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding\ntheir interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a\nsubstantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring\ndirection shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a\nconsistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our\nfindings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new\nstate-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark.

SkyDreamer runs fully onboard without external aid,\nresolves visual ambiguities by tracking progress using the state decoded from\nthe world model's hidden state, and requires no extrinsic camera calibration,\nenabling rapid deployment across different drones without retraining.\nReal-world experiments show that SkyDreamer achieves robust, high-speed flight,\nexecuting tight maneuvers such as an inverted loop, a split-S and a ladder,\nreaching speeds of up to 21 m/s and accelerations of up to 6 g. It further\ndemonstrates a non-trivial visual sim-to-real transfer by operating on\npoor-quality segmentation masks, and exhibits robustness to battery depletion\nby accurately estimating the maximum attainable motor RPM and adjusting its\nflight path in real-time. These results highlight SkyDreamer's adaptability to\nimportant aspects of the reality gap, bringing robustness while still achieving\nextremely high-speed, agile flight."

The pretrained model can then be efficiently refined with a small\namount of high-quality paired editing data. Built upon HunyuanVideoT2V, our\nframework first pretrains on approximately 1M real video clips to learn basic\nediting concepts, and subsequently fine-tunes on fewer than 150k curated\nediting pairs to extend more editing tasks and improve the editing quality.\nComparative experiments show that our method surpasses existing\ninstruction-based video editing approaches in both instruction alignment and\nvisual fidelity, achieving a 12\\% improvement in editing instruction following\nand a 15\\% improvement in editing quality."

We\nbelieve an ideal tactile representation should explicitly ground contact\nmeasurements in a stable reference frame while preserving detailed sensory\ninformation, enabling policies to not only detect contact occurrence but also\nprecisely infer object geometry in the hand's coordinate system. We introduce\nSaTA (Spatially-anchored Tactile Awareness for dexterous manipulation), an\nend-to-end policy framework that explicitly anchors tactile features to the\nhand's kinematic frame through forward kinematics, enabling accurate geometric\nreasoning without requiring object models or explicit pose estimation. Our key\ninsight is that spatially grounded tactile representations allow policies to\nnot only detect contact occurrence but also precisely infer object geometry in\nthe hand's coordinate system. We validate SaTA on challenging dexterous\nmanipulation tasks, including bimanual USB-C mating in free space, a task\ndemanding sub-millimeter alignment precision, as well as light bulb\ninstallation requiring precise thread engagement and rotational control, and\ncard sliding that demands delicate force modulation and angular precision.\nThese tasks represent significant challenges for learning-based methods due to\ntheir stringent precision requirements.

      "summary": "Consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation seeks to produce\nidentity-preserving images of the same subject across diverse scenes, yet it\noften fails due to a phenomenon called identity (ID) shift. Previous methods\nhave tackled this issue, but typically rely on the unrealistic assumption of\nknowing all target scenes in advance. This paper reveals that a key source of\nID shift is the native correlation between subject and scene context, called\nscene contextualization, which arises naturally as T2I models fit the training\ndistribution of vast natural images. We formally prove the near-universality of\nthis scene-ID correlation and derive theoretical bounds on its strength. On\nthis basis, we propose a novel, efficient, training-free prompt embedding\nediting approach, called Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC), that imposes an\ninversion process of T2I's built-in scene contextualization. Specifically, it\nidentifies and suppresses the latent scene-ID correlation within the ID\nprompt's embedding by quantifying the SVD directional stability to adaptively\nre-weight the corresponding eigenvalues. Critically, SDeC allows for per-scene\nuse (one scene per prompt) without requiring prior access to all target scenes.\nThis makes it a highly flexible and general solution well-suited to real-world\napplications where such prior knowledge is often unavailable or varies over\ntime. Experiments demonstrate that SDeC significantly enhances identity\npreservation while maintaining scene diversity."

Although pre-trained vision-language models\ncan achieve a general alignment between image and text, they often require\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for further adjustment. Today's PEFT\nmethods (e.g., prompt tuning, LoRA-based, or adapter-based) always selectively\nfine-tune a subset of parameters, which can slightly adjust either visual or\ntextual features, and avoid overfitting. In this paper, we are the first to\nhighlight that all existing PEFT methods perform one-step adjustment. It is\ninsufficient for complex (or difficult) datasets, where features of different\nmodalities are highly entangled. To this end, we propose the first\nmodel-agnostic multi-step adjustment approach by learning a cross-modal\nvelocity field: Flow Matching Alignment (FMA). Specifically, to ensure the\ncorrespondence between categories during training, we first utilize a fixed\ncoupling strategy. Then, we propose a noise augmentation strategy to alleviate\nthe data scarcity issue. Finally, we design an early-stopping solver, which\nterminates the transformation process earlier, improving both efficiency and\naccuracy.

Through\na reconstruction-driven pre-training scheme, VisualSplit learns to capture the\nessence of each visual descriptor while preserving their interpretability.

While this\npattern could output diverse images, some of them may fail to align well with\nthe prompt. Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the\ndenoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection.\nIn this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch:\nduring training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of\nthe latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a\nprompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector\nthat applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.\nConditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware\ncounterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,\nwithout modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first\nsample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding\nimages from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a\nreward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct\npreference optimization. Our design has two benefits: (i) it requires no\nreference images or handcrafted priors, and (ii) it incurs small inference\ncost, replacing multi-sample selection with a single forward pass. Extensive\nexperiments further show that our prompt-aware noise projection improves\ntext-image alignment across diverse prompts."

Nonetheless, existing NVC schemes have several limitations,\nincluding inefficiency in dealing with disocclusion and new content, interframe\nerror propagation and accumulation, among others. To eliminate these\nlimitations, we borrow the idea from classic video coding schemes, which allow\nintra coding within inter-coded frames. With the intra coding tool enabled,\ndisocclusion and new content are properly handled, and interframe error\npropagation is naturally intercepted without the need for manual refresh\nmechanisms. We present an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding,\nwhere every frame is processed by a single model that is trained to perform\nintra/inter coding adaptively. Moreover, we propose a simultaneous two-frame\ncompression design to exploit interframe redundancy not only forwardly but also\nbackwardly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms DCVC-RT by an\naverage of 10.7\\% BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality\nper frame, and retains real-time encoding/decoding performances.

However, when\nemploying these models to create composite sequences containing multiple\nsemantically generated motion clips, they often struggle to preserve the\ncontinuity of motion dynamics at the transition boundaries between clips,\nresulting in awkward transitions and abrupt artifacts. To address these\nchallenges, we present Compositional Phase Diffusion, which leverages the\nSemantic Phase Diffusion Module (SPDM) and Transitional Phase Diffusion Module\n(TPDM) to progressively incorporate semantic guidance and phase details from\nadjacent motion clips into the diffusion process. Specifically, SPDM and TPDM\noperate within the latent motion frequency domain established by the\npre-trained Action-Centric Motion Phase Autoencoder (ACT-PAE). This allows them\nto learn semantically important and transition-aware phase information from\nvariable-length motion clips during training. Experimental results demonstrate\nthe competitive performance of our proposed framework in generating\ncompositional motion sequences that align semantically with the input\nconditions, while preserving phase transitional continuity between preceding\nand succeeding motion clips. Additionally, motion inbetweening task is made\npossible by keeping the phase parameter of the input motion sequences fixed\nthroughout the diffusion process, showcasing the potential for extending the\nproposed framework to accommodate various application scenarios.

Additionally, they often fail to respond to\nthe user's requirements for desired fine-grained spatial understanding. This\nissue might arise because existing approaches primarily focus on tuning MLLMs\nto model pre-annotated instruction data to inject spatial knowledge, without\ndirect supervision of MLLMs' actual responses. We address this issue by SPR, a\nSpatial Preference Rewarding~(SPR) approach that enhances MLLMs' spatial\ncapabilities by rewarding MLLMs' detailed responses with precise object\nlocalization over vague or inaccurate responses. With randomly selected image\nregions and region descriptions from MLLMs, SPR introduces semantic and\nlocalization scores to comprehensively evaluate the text quality and\nlocalization quality in MLLM-generated descriptions. We also refine the MLLM\ndescriptions with better localization accuracy and pair the best-scored\nrefinement with the initial descriptions of the lowest score for direct\npreference optimization, thereby enhancing fine-grained alignment with visual\ninput.

Our\napproach demonstrates that expertise need not monopolize. Instead, through\ncollaborative expert utilization, we can achieve superior performance while\nmaintaining computational efficiency. AdaMoE consistently outperforms the\nbaseline model across key benchmarks, delivering performance gains of 1.8% on\nLIBERO and 9.3% on RoboTwin. Most importantly, a substantial 21.5% improvement\nin real-world experiments validates its practical effectiveness for robotic\nmanipulation tasks."

However, matching of high-resolution images remains challenging due\nto the quadratic complexity and lack of explicit matching constraints in the\nexisting cross-attention. This paper proposes an attention mechanism,\nMatchAttention, that dynamically matches relative positions. The relative\nposition determines the attention sampling center of the key-value pairs given\na query. Continuous and differentiable sliding-window attention sampling is\nachieved by the proposed BilinearSoftmax. The relative positions are\niteratively updated through residual connections across layers by embedding\nthem into the feature channels. Since the relative position is exactly the\nlearning target for cross-view matching, an efficient hierarchical cross-view\ndecoder, MatchDecoder, is designed with MatchAttention as its core component.\nTo handle cross-view occlusions, gated cross-MatchAttention and a\nconsistency-constrained loss are proposed. These two components collectively\nmitigate the impact of occlusions in both forward and backward passes, allowing\nthe model to focus more on learning matching relationships. When applied to\nstereo matching, MatchStereo-B ranked 1st in average error on the public\nMiddlebury benchmark and requires only 29ms for KITTI-resolution inference.\nMatchStereo-T can process 4K UHD images in 0.1 seconds using only 3GB of GPU\nmemory. The proposed models also achieve state-of-the-art performance on KITTI\n2012, KITTI 2015, ETH3D, and Spring flow datasets.

Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation\nincludes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties\nin maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the\ngenerated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant\nexpression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human\nface occupies merely a small fraction of the image.

Instead of introducing\nauxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a\ndirect and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a\nface identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our\nmethod backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling\nchain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial\nscoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature\npools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A\nKL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and\nprevent overfitting to the reward signal.

To address these issues, OCC system utilizing an\nevent-based vision sensor (EVS) as receivers have been proposed. The EVS\nenables high-speed, low-latency, and robust communication due to its\nasynchronous operation and high dynamic range. In existing event-based OCC\nsystems, conventional modulation schemes such as on-off keying (OOK) and pulse\nposition modulation have been applied, however, to the best of our knowledge,\nno modulation method has been proposed that fully exploits the unique\ncharacteristics of the EVS.

EIM enables improvement in transmission speed by modulating\ninformation using the intervals between events. This paper proposes a\ntheoretical model of EIM and conducts a proof-of-concept experiment. First, the\nparameters of the EVS are tuned and customized to optimize the frequency\nresponse specifically for EIM. Then, the maximum modulation order usable in EIM\nis determined experimentally.
