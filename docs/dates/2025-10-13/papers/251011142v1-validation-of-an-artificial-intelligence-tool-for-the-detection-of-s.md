## 摘要（原文）

> Sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) is a critical parameter in male fertility
> assessment that conventional semen analysis fails to evaluate. This study
> presents the validation of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) tool designed
> to detect SDF through digital analysis of phase contrast microscopy images,
> using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
> assay as the gold standard reference. Utilising the established link between
> sperm morphology and DNA integrity, the present work proposes a morphology
> assisted ensemble AI model that combines image processing techniques with
> state-of-the-art transformer based machine learning models (GC-ViT) for the
> prediction of DNA fragmentation in sperm from phase contrast images. The
> ensemble model is benchmarked against a pure transformer `vision' model as well
> as a `morphology-only` model. Promising results show the proposed framework is
> able to achieve sensitivity of 60\% and specificity of 75\%. This
> non-destructive methodology represents a significant advancement in
> reproductive medicine by enabling real-time sperm selection based on DNA
> integrity for clinical diagnostic and therapeutic applications.
