## 摘要（原文）

> Accurate real-time estimation of end effector interaction forces in hydraulic
> excavators is a key enabler for advanced automation in heavy machinery.
> Accurate knowledge of these forces allows improved, precise grading and digging
> maneuvers. To address these challenges, we introduce a high-accuracy,
> retrofittable 2D force- and payload estimation algorithm that does not impose
> additional requirements on the operator regarding trajectory, acceleration or
> the use of the slew joint. The approach is designed for retrofittability,
> requires minimal calibration and no prior knowledge of machine-specific dynamic
> characteristics. Specifically, we propose a method for identifying a dynamic
> model, necessary to estimate both end effector interaction forces and bucket
> payload during normal operation. Our optimization-based payload estimation
> achieves a full-scale payload accuracy of 1%. On a standard 25 t excavator, the
> online force measurement from pressure and inertial measurements achieves a
> direction accuracy of 13 degree and a magnitude accuracy of 383 N. The method's
> accuracy and generalization capability are validated on two excavator platforms
> of different type and weight classes. We benchmark our payload estimation
> against a classical quasistatic method and a commercially available system. Our
> system outperforms both in accuracy and precision.
