**关键词**：控制合成, 时空管, 非线性系统, 规定时间控制, 避障控制

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：控制仿射非线性系统在规定时间内满足到达-避障-停留规范，避免绕行函数导致的突变和高控制成本。
- 方法要点：构建平滑时空管，实现连续避障和目标引导，并推导无近似闭环控制律。
- 实验或效果：案例研究表明控制成本显著降低，优于先前方法。

## 摘要（原文）

> In this work, we address the issue of controller synthesis for a
> control-affine nonlinear system to meet prescribed time reach-avoid-stay
> specifications. Our goal is to improve upon previous methods based on
> spatiotemporal tubes (STTs) by eliminating the need for circumvent functions,
> which often lead to abrupt tube modifications and high control effort. We
> propose an adaptive framework that constructs smooth STTs around static unsafe
> sets, enabling continuous avoidance while guiding the system toward the target
> within the prescribed time. A closed-form, approximation-free control law is
> derived to ensure the system trajectory remains within the tube and satisfies
> the RAS task. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated
> through a case study, showing a significant reduction in control effort
> compared to prior methods.
