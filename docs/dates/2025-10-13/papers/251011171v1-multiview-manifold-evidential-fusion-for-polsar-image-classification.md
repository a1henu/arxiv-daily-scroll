- 在三个真实数据集上验证，方法在精度、鲁棒性和可解释性上优于现有方法

## 摘要（原文）

> Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) covariance matrices and their
> extracted multi-features - such as scattering angle, entropy, texture, and
> boundary descriptors - provide complementary and physically interpretable
> information for image classification. Traditional fusion strategies typically
> concatenate these features or employ deep learning networks to combine them.
> However, the covariance matrices and multi-features, as two complementary
> views, lie on different manifolds with distinct geometric structures. Existing
> fusion methods also overlook the varying importance of different views and
> ignore uncertainty, often leading to unreliable predictions. To address these
> issues, we propose a Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion (MMEFnet) method to
> effectively fuse these two views. It gives a new framework to integrate PolSAR
> manifold learning and evidence fusion into a unified architecture.
> Specifically, covariance matrices are represented on the Hermitian Positive
> Definite (HPD) manifold, while multi-features are modeled on the Grassmann
> manifold. Two different kernel metric learning networks are constructed to
> learn their manifold representations. Subsequently, a trusted multiview
> evidence fusion, replacing the conventional softmax classifier, estimates
> belief mass and quantifies the uncertainty of each view from the learned deep
> features. Finally, a Dempster-Shafer theory-based fusion strategy combines
> evidence, enabling a more reliable and interpretable classification. Extensive
> experiments on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
> method consistently outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness,
> and interpretability.
