## 摘要（原文）

> MAVs have great potential to assist humans in complex tasks, with
> applications ranging from logistics to emergency response. Their agility makes
> them ideal for operations in complex and dynamic environments. However,
> achieving precise control in agile flights remains a significant challenge,
> particularly due to the underactuated nature of quadrotors and the strong
> coupling between their translational and rotational dynamics. In this work, we
> propose a novel NMPC framework based on dual-quaternions (DQ-NMPC) for
> quadrotor flight. By representing both quadrotor dynamics and the pose error
> directly on the dual-quaternion manifold, our approach enables a compact and
> globally non-singular formulation that captures the quadrotor coupled dynamics.
> We validate our approach through simulations and real-world experiments,
> demonstrating better numerical conditioning and significantly improved tracking
> performance, with reductions in position and orientation errors of up to 56.11%
> and 56.77%, compared to a conventional baseline NMPC method. Furthermore, our
> controller successfully handles aggressive trajectories, reaching maximum
> speeds up to 13.66 m/s and accelerations reaching 4.2 g within confined space
> conditions of dimensions 11m x 4.5m x 3.65m under which the baseline controller
> fails.
