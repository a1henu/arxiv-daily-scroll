## 摘要（原文）

> Surface normal integration is a fundamental problem in computer vision,
> dealing with the objective of reconstructing a surface from its corresponding
> normal map. Existing approaches require an iterative global optimization to
> jointly estimate the depth of each pixel, which scales poorly to larger normal
> maps. In this paper, we address this problem by recasting normal integration as
> the estimation of relative scales of continuous components. By constraining
> pixels belonging to the same component to jointly vary their scale, we
> drastically reduce the number of optimization variables. Our framework includes
> a heuristic to accurately estimate continuous components from the start, a
> strategy to rebalance optimization terms, and a technique to iteratively merge
> components to further reduce the size of the problem. Our method achieves
> state-of-the-art results on the standard normal integration benchmark in as
> little as a few seconds and achieves one-order-of-magnitude speedup over
> pixel-level approaches on large-resolution normal maps.
