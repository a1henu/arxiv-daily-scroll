## 摘要（原文）

> Combining large language models with evolutionary computation algorithms
> represents a promising research direction leveraging the remarkable generative
> and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs with the strengths of evolutionary
> algorithms. In this work, we present EvoCAD, a method for generating
> computer-aided design (CAD) objects through their symbolic representations
> using vision language models and evolutionary optimization. Our method samples
> multiple CAD objects, which are then optimized using an evolutionary approach
> with vision language and reasoning language models. We assess our method using
> GPT-4V and GPT-4o, evaluating it on the CADPrompt benchmark dataset and
> comparing it to prior methods. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics based
> on topological properties defined by the Euler characteristic, which capture a
> form of semantic similarity between 3D objects. Our results demonstrate that
> EvoCAD outperforms previous approaches on multiple metrics, particularly in
> generating topologically correct objects, which can be efficiently evaluated
> using our two novel metrics that complement existing spatial metrics.
