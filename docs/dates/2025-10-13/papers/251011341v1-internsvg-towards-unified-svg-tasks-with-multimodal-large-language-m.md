## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：SVG建模因数据集碎片化、方法迁移性差和结构复杂而具挑战性。
- 方法要点：构建SAgoge数据集和SArena基准，采用SVG专用令牌和两阶段训练策略。
- 实验或效果：在SArena和先前基准上，InternSVG显著优于现有开源和专有模型。

## 摘要（原文）

> General SVG modeling remains challenging due to fragmented datasets, limited
> transferability of methods across tasks, and the difficulty of handling
> structural complexity. In response, we leverage the strong transfer and
> generalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
> achieve unified modeling for SVG understanding, editing, and generation. We
> present the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its
> core is SAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG
> tasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers
> icons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic
> animations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper
> hierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this
> resource, we introduce SArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task
> definitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and
> difficulty spectrum covered by SAgoge. Building on these foundations, we
> propose InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG understanding, editing, and
> generation with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding
> initialization, and a two-stage training strategy that progresses from short
> static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified
> formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance.
> Experiments on SArena and prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves
> substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary
> counterparts.
