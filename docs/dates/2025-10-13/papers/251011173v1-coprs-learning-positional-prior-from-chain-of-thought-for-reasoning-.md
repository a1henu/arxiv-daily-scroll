**作者**：Zhenyu Lu, Liupeng Li, Jinpeng Wang, Yan Feng, Bin Chen, Ke Chen, Yaowei Wang  

**一句话要点**：提出CoPRS模型，通过可微分热图桥接语言推理与分割，提升可解释性与精度。

**关键词**：推理分割, 多模态思维链, 可微分热图, 位置先验, 掩码生成, 可解释性

## 3 点简述
- 现有推理分割方法直接连接语言模型特征或文本位置，限制可解释性与语义细节。
- CoPRS基于多模态思维链生成可微分位置先验热图，通过轻量解码器输出精确掩码。
- 在RefCOCO系列和ReasonSeg数据集上，性能达到或超越现有最佳结果，热图质量影响掩码质量。

## 摘要（原文）

> Existing works on reasoning segmentation either connect hidden features from
> a language model directly to a mask decoder or represent positions in text,
> which limits interpretability and semantic detail. To solve this, we present
> CoPRS, a Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)-based positional perception model
> that bridges language reasoning to segmentation through a differentiable and
> interpretable positional prior instantiated as a heatmap. By making the
> reasoning process clear via MCoT and expressing it as a dense, differentiable
> heatmap, this interface enhances interpretability and diagnostic analysis and
> yields more concentrated evidence on the target. A learnable concentration
> token aggregates features of the image and reasoning text to generate this
> positional prior, which is decoded to precise masks through a lightweight
> decoder, providing a direct connection between reasoning and segmentation.
> Across the RefCOCO series and ReasonSeg, CoPRS matches or surpasses the best
> reported metrics on each standard split under comparable protocols, with
> performance at or above prior state of the art across both validation and test
> partitions. Extensive experiments reveal that the quality of the heatmap
> strongly influences the resulting mask quality, supporting a consistent
> association between the reasoning output and downstream mask generation.
> Collectively, these findings support the utility of this paradigm in bridging
> reasoning and segmentation and show advantages in concentration driven by
> reasoning and predicting masks more precisely. Code, checkpoints and logs are
> released at https://github.com/ZhenyuLU-Heliodore/CoPRS.git.
