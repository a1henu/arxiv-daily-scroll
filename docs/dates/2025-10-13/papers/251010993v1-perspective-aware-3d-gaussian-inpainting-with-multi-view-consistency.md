## 摘要（原文）

> 3D Gaussian inpainting, a critical technique for numerous applications in
> virtual reality and multimedia, has made significant progress with pretrained
> diffusion models. However, ensuring multi-view consistency, an essential
> requirement for high-quality inpainting, remains a key challenge. In this work,
> we present PAInpainter, a novel approach designed to advance 3D Gaussian
> inpainting by leveraging perspective-aware content propagation and consistency
> verification across multi-view inpainted images. Our method iteratively refines
> inpainting and optimizes the 3D Gaussian representation with multiple views
> adaptively sampled from a perspective graph. By propagating inpainted images as
> prior information and verifying consistency across neighboring views,
> PAInpainter substantially enhances global consistency and texture fidelity in
> restored 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
> PAInpainter over existing methods. Our approach achieves superior 3D inpainting
> quality, with PSNR scores of 26.03 dB and 29.51 dB on the SPIn-NeRF and
> NeRFiller datasets, respectively, highlighting its effectiveness and
> generalization capability.
