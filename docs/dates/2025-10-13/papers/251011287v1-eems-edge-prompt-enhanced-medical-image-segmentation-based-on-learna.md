## 摘要（原文）

> Medical image segmentation is vital for diagnosis, treatment planning, and
> disease monitoring but is challenged by complex factors like ambiguous edges
> and background noise. We introduce EEMS, a new model for segmentation,
> combining an Edge-Aware Enhancement Unit (EAEU) and a Multi-scale Prompt
> Generation Unit (MSPGU). EAEU enhances edge perception via multi-frequency
> feature extraction, accurately defining boundaries. MSPGU integrates high-level
> semantic and low-level spatial features using a prompt-guided approach,
> ensuring precise target localization. The Dual-Source Adaptive Gated Fusion
> Unit (DAGFU) merges edge features from EAEU with semantic features from MSPGU,
> enhancing segmentation accuracy and robustness. Tests on datasets like ISIC2018
> confirm EEMS's superior performance and reliability as a clinical tool.
