## 摘要（原文）

> Realistic traffic simulation is critical for ensuring the safety and
> reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially in complex and diverse
> urban traffic environments. However, existing data-driven simulators face two
> key challenges: a limited focus on modeling dense, heterogeneous interactions
> at urban intersections - which are prevalent, crucial, and practically
> significant in countries like China, featuring diverse agents including
> motorized vehicles (MVs), non-motorized vehicles (NMVs), and pedestrians - and
> the inherent difficulty in robustly learning high-dimensional joint
> distributions for such high-density scenes, often leading to mode collapse and
> long-term simulation instability. We introduce City Crossings Dataset
> (CiCross), a large-scale dataset collected from a real-world urban
> intersection, uniquely capturing dense, heterogeneous multi-agent interactions,
> particularly with a substantial proportion of MVs, NMVs and pedestrians. Based
> on this dataset, we propose IntersectioNDE (Intersection Naturalistic Driving
> Environment), a data-driven simulator tailored for complex urban intersection
> scenarios. Its core component is the Interaction Decoupling Strategy (IDS), a
> training paradigm that learns compositional dynamics from agent subsets,
> enabling the marginal-to-joint simulation. Integrated into a scene-aware
> Transformer network with specialized training techniques, IDS significantly
> enhances simulation robustness and long-term stability for modeling
> heterogeneous interactions. Experiments on CiCross show that IntersectioNDE
> outperforms baseline methods in simulation fidelity, stability, and its ability
> to replicate complex, distribution-level urban traffic dynamics.
