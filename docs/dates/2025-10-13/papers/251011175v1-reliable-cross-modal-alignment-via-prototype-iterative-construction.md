- 实验或效果：在多个基准上优于SOTA方法5.2%-14.1%

## 摘要（原文）

> Cross-modal alignment is an important multi-modal task, aiming to bridge the
> semantic gap between different modalities. The most reliable fundamention for
> achieving this objective lies in the semantic consistency between matched
> pairs. Conventional methods implicitly assume embeddings contain solely
> semantic information, ignoring the impact of non-semantic information during
> alignment, which inevitably leads to information bias or even loss. These
> non-semantic information primarily manifest as stylistic variations in the
> data, which we formally define as style information. An intuitive approach is
> to separate style from semantics, aligning only the semantic information.
> However, most existing methods distinguish them based on feature columns, which
> cannot represent the complex coupling relationship between semantic and style
> information. In this paper, we propose PICO, a novel framework for suppressing
> style interference during embedding interaction. Specifically, we quantify the
> probability of each feature column representing semantic information, and
> regard it as the weight during the embedding interaction. To ensure the
> reliability of the semantic probability, we propose a prototype iterative
> construction method. The key operation of this method is a performance
> feedback-based weighting function, and we have theoretically proven that the
> function can assign higher weight to prototypes that bring higher performance
> improvements. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and model backbones
> demonstrate the superiority of PICO, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by
> 5.2\%-14.1\%.
