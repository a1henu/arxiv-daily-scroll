**一句话要点**：提出VGDCFusion网络，耦合退化建模与图像融合以处理退化红外和可见光图像

**关键词**：红外和可见光图像融合, 退化建模, 视觉语言模型, 退化感知, 特征融合

## 3 点简述
- 现有红外和可见光图像融合方法假设高质量输入，处理退化图像时性能下降
- 使用VLM引导退化感知，SPDCE和JPDCF模块耦合退化抑制与特征提取融合
- 实验表明VGDCFusion在多种退化场景下优于现有方法，代码已开源

## 摘要（原文）

> Existing Infrared and Visible Image Fusion (IVIF) methods typically assume
> high-quality inputs. However, when handing degraded images, these methods
> heavily rely on manually switching between different pre-processing techniques.
> This decoupling of degradation handling and image fusion leads to significant
> performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel VLM-Guided
> Degradation-Coupled Fusion network (VGDCFusion), which tightly couples
> degradation modeling with the fusion process and leverages vision-language
> models (VLMs) for degradation-aware perception and guided suppression.
> Specifically, the proposed Specific-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Extractor
> (SPDCE) enables modality-specific degradation awareness and establishes a joint
> modeling of degradation suppression and intra-modal feature extraction. In
> parallel, the Joint-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Fusion (JPDCF) facilitates
> cross-modal degradation perception and couples residual degradation filtering
> with complementary cross-modal feature fusion. Extensive experiments
> demonstrate that our VGDCFusion significantly outperforms existing
> state-of-the-art fusion approaches under various degraded image scenarios. Our
> code is available at https://github.com/Lmmh058/VGDCFusion.
