**arXiv**：[2510.11552v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11552) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11552.pdf)  
**作者**：Gregoire Passault, Clement Gaspard, Olivier Ly  

**一句话要点**：提出全向轮足球机器人套件，结合外部追踪系统以解决教育机器人感知局限问题。

**关键词**：教育机器人, 全向轮机器人, 外部追踪系统, 机器人套件, 项目导向教学

## 3 点简述
- 当前教育机器人套件感知局限于自我中心，难以处理坐标和导航等高阶问题。
- 方法采用全向轮机器人套件，集成外部追踪系统，减轻嵌入式系统负担。
- 效果是使学生在教育环境中探索机器人高阶方面，提升多学科技能。

## 摘要（原文）

> Recent developments of low cost off-the-shelf programmable components, their
> modularity, and also rapid prototyping made educational robotics flourish, as
> it is accessible in most schools today. They allow to illustrate and embody
> theoretical problems in practical and tangible applications, and gather
> multidisciplinary skills. They also give a rich natural context for
> project-oriented pedagogy. However, most current robot kits all are limited to
> egocentric aspect of the robots perception. This makes it difficult to access
> more high-level problems involving e.g. coordinates or navigation. In this
> paper we introduce an educational holonomous robot kit that comes with an
> external tracking system, which lightens the constraint on embedded systems,
> but allows in the same time to discover high-level aspects of robotics,
> otherwise unreachable.
