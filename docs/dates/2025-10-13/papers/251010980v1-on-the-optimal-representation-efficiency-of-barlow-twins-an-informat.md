## 摘要（原文）

> Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved remarkable success by learning
> meaningful representations without labeled data. However, a unified theoretical
> framework for understanding and comparing the efficiency of different SSL
> paradigms remains elusive. In this paper, we introduce a novel
> information-geometric framework to quantify representation efficiency. We
> define representation efficiency $\eta$ as the ratio between the effective
> intrinsic dimension of the learned representation space and its ambient
> dimension, where the effective dimension is derived from the spectral
> properties of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) on the statistical manifold
> induced by the encoder. Within this framework, we present a theoretical
> analysis of the Barlow Twins method. Under specific but natural assumptions, we
> prove that Barlow Twins achieves optimal representation efficiency ($\eta = 1$)
> by driving the cross-correlation matrix of representations towards the identity
> matrix, which in turn induces an isotropic FIM. This work provides a rigorous
> theoretical foundation for understanding the effectiveness of Barlow Twins and
> offers a new geometric perspective for analyzing SSL algorithms.
