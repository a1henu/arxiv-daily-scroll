## 摘要（原文）

> Real-world point cloud datasets have made significant contributions to the
> development of LiDAR-based perception technologies, such as object segmentation
> for autonomous driving. However, due to the limited number of instances in some
> rare classes, the long-tail problem remains a major challenge in existing
> datasets. To address this issue, we introduce a novel, synthetic point cloud
> dataset named RareBoost3D, which complements existing real-world datasets by
> providing significantly more instances for object classes that are rare in
> real-world datasets. To effectively leverage both synthetic and real-world
> data, we further propose a cross-domain semantic alignment method named CSC
> loss that aligns feature representations of the same class across different
> domains. Experimental results demonstrate that this alignment significantly
> enhances the performance of LiDAR point cloud segmentation models over
> real-world data.
