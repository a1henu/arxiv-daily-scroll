## 摘要（原文）

> Object detection systems have traditionally relied on supervised learning
> with manually annotated bounding boxes, achieving high accuracy at the cost of
> substantial annotation investment. The emergence of Vision-Language Models
> (VLMs) offers an alternative paradigm enabling zero-shot detection through
> natural language queries, eliminating annotation requirements but operating
> with reduced accuracy. This paper presents the first comprehensive
> cost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised detection (YOLO) with
> zero-shot VLM inference (Gemini Flash 2.5). Through systematic evaluation on
> 1,000 stratified COCO images and 200 diverse product images spanning consumer
> electronics and rare categories, combined with detailed Total Cost of Ownership
> modeling, we establish quantitative break-even thresholds governing
> architecture selection. Our findings reveal that supervised YOLO achieves 91.2%
> accuracy versus 68.5% for zero-shot Gemini on standard categories, representing
> a 22.7 percentage point advantage that costs $10,800 in annotation for
> 100-category systems. However, this advantage justifies investment only beyond
> 55 million inferences, equivalent to 151,000 images daily for one year.
> Zero-shot Gemini demonstrates 52.3% accuracy on diverse product categories
> (ranging from highly web-prevalent consumer electronics at 75-85% to rare
> specialized equipment at 25-40%) where supervised YOLO achieves 0% due to
> architectural constraints preventing detection of untrained classes. Cost per
> Correct Detection analysis reveals substantially lower per-detection costs for
> Gemini ($0.00050 vs $0.143) at 100,000 inferences despite accuracy deficits. We
> develop decision frameworks demonstrating that optimal architecture selection
> depends critically on deployment volume, category stability, budget
> constraints, and accuracy requirements rather than purely technical performance
> metrics.
