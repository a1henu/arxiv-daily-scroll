## 摘要（原文）

> Sign languages serve as essential communication systems for individuals with
> hearing and speech impairments. However, digital linguistic dataset resources
> for underrepresented sign languages, such as Nepali Sign Language (NSL), remain
> scarce. This study introduces the first benchmark dataset for NSL, consisting
> of 36 gesture classes with 1,500 samples per class, designed to capture the
> structural and visual features of the language. To evaluate recognition
> performance, we fine-tuned MobileNetV2 and ResNet50 architectures on the
> dataset, achieving classification accuracies of 90.45% and 88.78%,
> respectively. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of convolutional
> neural networks in sign recognition tasks, particularly within low-resource
> settings. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first
> systematic effort to construct a benchmark dataset and assess deep learning
> approaches for NSL recognition, highlighting the potential of transfer learning
> and fine-tuning for advancing research in underexplored sign languages.
