## 摘要（原文）

> Recent approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
> success in achieving fast downstream adaptation. When applied to real-world
> downstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data
> and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The OOD datasets often include both
> covariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and
> semantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the
> importance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD
> data, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In
> this paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set
> data when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly
> reducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel
> OOD score, named {\Delta}Energy. {\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the
> vanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD
> detection. Furthermore, {\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD
> generalization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound
> maximization for {\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to
> not only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian,
> which serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization. Based on this
> finding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving
> VLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection. Extensive
> experiments on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks
> demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming recent approaches by
> 10% to 25% in AUROC.
