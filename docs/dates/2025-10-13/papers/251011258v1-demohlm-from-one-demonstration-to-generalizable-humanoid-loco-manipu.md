## 摘要（原文）

> Loco-manipulation is a fundamental challenge for humanoid robots to achieve
> versatile interactions in human environments. Although recent studies have made
> significant progress in humanoid whole-body control, loco-manipulation remains
> underexplored and often relies on hard-coded task definitions or costly
> real-world data collection, which limits autonomy and generalization. We
> present DemoHLM, a framework for humanoid loco-manipulation that enables
> generalizable loco-manipulation on a real humanoid robot from a single
> demonstration in simulation. DemoHLM adopts a hierarchy that integrates a
> low-level universal whole-body controller with high-level manipulation policies
> for multiple tasks. The whole-body controller maps whole-body motion commands
> to joint torques and provides omnidirectional mobility for the humanoid robot.
> The manipulation policies, learned in simulation via our data generation and
> imitation learning pipeline, command the whole-body controller with closed-loop
> visual feedback to execute challenging loco-manipulation tasks. Experiments
> show a positive correlation between the amount of synthetic data and policy
> performance, underscoring the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline and
> the data efficiency of our approach. Real-world experiments on a Unitree G1
> robot equipped with an RGB-D camera validate the sim-to-real transferability of
> DemoHLM, demonstrating robust performance under spatial variations across ten
> loco-manipulation tasks.
