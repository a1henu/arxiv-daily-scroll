## 摘要（原文）

> While significant research has focused on developing embodied reasoning
> capabilities using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or integrating advanced VLMs
> into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end robot control, few
> studies directly address the critical gap between upstream VLM-based reasoning
> and downstream VLA policy learning. In this work, we take an initial step
> toward bridging embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning by introducing
> Vlaser - a Vision-Language-Action Model with synergistic embodied reasoning
> capability, which is a foundational vision-language model designed to integrate
> high-level reasoning with low-level control for embodied agents. Built upon the
> high-quality Vlaser-6M dataset, Vlaser achieves state-of-the-art performance
> across a range of embodied reasoning benchmarks - including spatial reasoning,
> embodied grounding, embodied QA, and task planning. Furthermore, we
> systematically examine how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA
> fine-tuning, offering novel insights into mitigating the domain shift between
> internet-scale pre-training data and embodied-specific policy learning data.
> Based on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the
> WidowX benchmark and competitive performance on the Google Robot benchmark.
