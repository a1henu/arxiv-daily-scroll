## 摘要（原文）

> This paper presents an AI-driven IoT robotic teleoperation system designed
> for real-time remote manipulation and intelligent visual monitoring, tailored
> for smart city applications. The architecture integrates a Flutter-based
> cross-platform mobile interface with MQTT-based control signaling and WebRTC
> video streaming via the LiveKit framework. A YOLOv11-nano model is deployed for
> lightweight object detection, enabling real-time perception with annotated
> visual overlays delivered to the user interface. Control commands are
> transmitted via MQTT to an ESP8266-based actuator node, which coordinates
> multi-axis robotic arm motion through an Arduino Mega2560 controller. The
> backend infrastructure is hosted on DigitalOcean, ensuring scalable cloud
> orchestration and stable global communication. Latency evaluations conducted
> under both local and international VPN scenarios (including Hong Kong, Japan,
> and Belgium) demonstrate actuator response times as low as 0.2 seconds and
> total video latency under 1.2 seconds, even across high-latency networks. This
> low-latency dual-protocol design ensures responsive closed-loop interaction and
> robust performance in distributed environments. Unlike conventional
> teleoperation platforms, the proposed system emphasizes modular deployment,
> real-time AI sensing, and adaptable communication strategies, making it
> well-suited for smart city scenarios such as remote infrastructure inspection,
> public equipment servicing, and urban automation. Future enhancements will
> focus on edge-device deployment, adaptive routing, and integration with
> city-scale IoT networks to enhance resilience and scalability.
