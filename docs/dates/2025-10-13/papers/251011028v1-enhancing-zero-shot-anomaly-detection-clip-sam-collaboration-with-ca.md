## 摘要（原文）

> Recently, the powerful generalization ability exhibited by foundation models
> has brought forth new solutions for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks.
> However, guiding these foundation models correctly to address downstream tasks
> remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel two-stage framework, for
> zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks in industrial anomaly detection. This
> framework excellently leverages the powerful anomaly localization capability of
> CLIP and the boundary perception ability of SAM.(1) To mitigate SAM's
> inclination towards object segmentation, we propose the Co-Feature Point Prompt
> Generation (PPG) module. This module collaboratively utilizes CLIP and SAM to
> generate positive and negative point prompts, guiding SAM to focus on
> segmenting anomalous regions rather than the entire object. (2) To further
> optimize SAM's segmentation results and mitigate rough boundaries and isolated
> noise, we introduce the Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS) module. This module
> employs hybrid prompts cascaded with a lightweight decoder of SAM, achieving
> precise segmentation of anomalous regions. Across multiple datasets, consistent
> experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves
> state-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly segmentation results. Particularly
> noteworthy is our performance on the Visa dataset, where we outperform the
> state-of-the-art methods by 10.3\% and 7.7\% in terms of {$F_1$-max} and AP
> metrics, respectively.
