**一句话要点**：提出iREPA方法，通过强调空间结构信息提升生成模型训练中的表示对齐效果。

**关键词**：表示对齐, 生成模型训练, 空间结构, 视觉编码器, 蒸馏训练

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：表示对齐中，全局语义信息还是空间结构对生成性能更重要？
- 方法要点：用卷积层替换MLP投影层，并引入空间归一化层以增强空间信息传递。
- 实验或效果：iREPA在多种视觉编码器和训练变体中一致提升收敛速度。

## 摘要（原文）

> Representation alignment (REPA) guides generative training by distilling representations from a strong, pretrained vision encoder to intermediate diffusion features. We investigate a fundamental question: what aspect of the target representation matters for generation, its \textit{global} \revision{semantic} information (e.g., measured by ImageNet-1K accuracy) or its spatial structure (i.e. pairwise cosine similarity between patch tokens)? Prevalent wisdom holds that stronger global semantic performance leads to better generation as a target representation. To study this, we first perform a large-scale empirical analysis across 27 different vision encoders and different model scales. The results are surprising; spatial structure, rather than global performance, drives the generation performance of a target representation. To further study this, we introduce two straightforward modifications, which specifically accentuate the transfer of \emph{spatial} information. We replace the standard MLP projection layer in REPA with a simple convolution layer and introduce a spatial normalization layer for the external representation. Surprisingly, our simple method (implemented in $<$4 lines of code), termed iREPA, consistently improves convergence speed of REPA, across a diverse set of vision encoders, model sizes, and training variants (such as REPA, REPA-E, Meanflow, JiT etc). %, etc. Our work motivates revisiting the fundamental working mechanism of representational alignment and how it can be leveraged for improved training of generative models.
