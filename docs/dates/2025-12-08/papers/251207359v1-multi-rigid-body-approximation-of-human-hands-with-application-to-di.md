## 摘要（原文）

> Human hand simulation plays a critical role in digital twin applications, requiring models that balance anatomical fidelity with computational efficiency. We present a complete pipeline for constructing multi-rigid-body approximations of human hands that preserve realistic appearance while enabling real-time physics simulation. Starting from optical motion capture of a specific human hand, we construct a personalized MANO (Multi-Abstracted hand model with Neural Operations) model and convert it to a URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) representation with anatomically consistent joint axes. The key technical challenge is projecting MANO's unconstrained SO(3) joint rotations onto the kinematically constrained joints of the rigid-body model. We derive closed-form solutions for single degree-of-freedom joints and introduce a Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH)-corrected iterative method for two degree-of-freedom joints that properly handles the non-commutativity of rotations. We validate our approach through digital twin experiments where reinforcement learning policies control the multi-rigid-body hand to replay captured human demonstrations. Quantitative evaluation shows sub-centimeter reconstruction error and successful grasp execution across diverse manipulation tasks.
