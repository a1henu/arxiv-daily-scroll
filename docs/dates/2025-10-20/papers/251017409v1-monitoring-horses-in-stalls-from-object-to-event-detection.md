**一句话要点**：提出基于视觉的监控系统以自动检测马厩中马匹和人的行为事件

**关键词**：目标检测, 多目标跟踪, 事件检测, 马匹监控, 自定义数据集

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：马厩马匹行为监控依赖人工，耗时且效率低，需自动化早期健康问题检测。
- 方法要点：使用YOLOv11和BoT-SORT进行目标检测与跟踪，结合轨迹和空间关系推断事件状态。
- 实验或效果：定性评估显示马相关事件检测可靠，但人员检测因数据不足存在局限。

## 摘要（原文）

> Monitoring the behavior of stalled horses is essential for early detection of
> health and welfare issues but remains labor-intensive and time-consuming. In
> this study, we present a prototype vision-based monitoring system that
> automates the detection and tracking of horses and people inside stables using
> object detection and multi-object tracking techniques. The system leverages
> YOLOv11 and BoT-SORT for detection and tracking, while event states are
> inferred based on object trajectories and spatial relations within the stall.
> To support development, we constructed a custom dataset annotated with
> assistance from foundation models CLIP and GroundingDINO. The system
> distinguishes between five event types and accounts for the camera's blind
> spots. Qualitative evaluation demonstrated reliable performance for
> horse-related events, while highlighting limitations in detecting people due to
> data scarcity. This work provides a foundation for real-time behavioral
> monitoring in equine facilities, with implications for animal welfare and
> stable management.
