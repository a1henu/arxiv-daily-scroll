**一句话要点**：提出对抗性衣物攻击，揭示多种防御方法在物理世界中的共同脆弱性。

**关键词**：对抗攻击, 物理世界防御, 对象检测, 对抗衣物, 攻击成功率, 深度学习安全

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：现有防御方法对基于补丁的物理世界对抗攻击存在漏洞，尤其在大尺寸攻击下。
- 方法要点：通过扩大补丁尺寸并设计自然外观的对抗性衣物，评估多种防御方法的鲁棒性。
- 实验或效果：单一对抗衣物在物理世界中攻击成功率高达96.06%，对九种防御模型均超过64.84%。

## 摘要（原文）

> In recent years, adversarial attacks against deep learning-based object
> detectors in the physical world have attracted much attention. To defend
> against these attacks, researchers have proposed various defense methods
> against adversarial patches, a typical form of physically-realizable attack.
> However, our experiments showed that simply enlarging the patch size could make
> these defense methods fail. Motivated by this, we evaluated various defense
> methods against adversarial clothes which have large coverage over the human
> body. Adversarial clothes provide a good test case for adversarial defense
> against patch-based attacks because they not only have large sizes but also
> look more natural than a large patch on humans. Experiments show that all the
> defense methods had poor performance against adversarial clothes in both the
> digital world and the physical world. In addition, we crafted a single set of
> clothes that broke multiple defense methods on Faster R-CNN. The set achieved
> an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96.06% against the undefended detector and over
> 64.84% ASRs against nine defended models in the physical world, unveiling the
> common vulnerability of existing adversarial defense methods against
> adversarial clothes. Code is available at:
