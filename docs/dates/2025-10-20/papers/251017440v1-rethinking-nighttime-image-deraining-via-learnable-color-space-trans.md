## 摘要（原文）

> Compared to daytime image deraining, nighttime image deraining poses
> significant challenges due to inherent complexities of nighttime scenarios and
> the lack of high-quality datasets that accurately represent the coupling effect
> between rain and illumination. In this paper, we rethink the task of nighttime
> image deraining and contribute a new high-quality benchmark, HQ-NightRain,
> which offers higher harmony and realism compared to existing datasets. In
> addition, we develop an effective Color Space Transformation Network (CST-Net)
> for better removing complex rain from nighttime scenes. Specifically, we
> propose a learnable color space converter (CSC) to better facilitate rain
> removal in the Y channel, as nighttime rain is more pronounced in the Y channel
> compared to the RGB color space. To capture illumination information for
> guiding nighttime deraining, implicit illumination guidance is introduced
> enabling the learned features to improve the model's robustness in complex
> scenarios. Extensive experiments show the value of our dataset and the
> effectiveness of our method. The source code and datasets are available at
> https://github.com/guanqiyuan/CST-Net.
