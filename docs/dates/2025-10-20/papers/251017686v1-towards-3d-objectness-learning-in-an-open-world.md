## 摘要（原文）

> Recent advancements in 3D object detection and novel category detection have
> made significant progress, yet research on learning generalized 3D objectness
> remains insufficient. In this paper, we delve into learning open-world 3D
> objectness, which focuses on detecting all objects in a 3D scene, including
> novel objects unseen during training. Traditional closed-set 3D detectors
> struggle to generalize to open-world scenarios, while directly incorporating 3D
> open-vocabulary models for open-world ability struggles with vocabulary
> expansion and semantic overlap. To achieve generalized 3D object discovery, We
> propose OP3Det, a class-agnostic Open-World Prompt-free 3D Detector to detect
> any objects within 3D scenes without relying on hand-crafted text prompts. We
> introduce the strong generalization and zero-shot capabilities of 2D foundation
> models, utilizing both 2D semantic priors and 3D geometric priors for
> class-agnostic proposals to broaden 3D object discovery. Then, by integrating
> complementary information from point cloud and RGB image in the cross-modal
> mixture of experts, OP3Det dynamically routes uni-modal and multi-modal
> features to learn generalized 3D objectness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
> the extraordinary performance of OP3Det, which significantly surpasses existing
> open-world 3D detectors by up to 16.0% in AR and achieves a 13.5% improvement
> compared to closed-world 3D detectors.
