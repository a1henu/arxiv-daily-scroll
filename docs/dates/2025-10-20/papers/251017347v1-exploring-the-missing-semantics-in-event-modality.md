**一句话要点**：提出Semantic-E2VID框架，通过引入语义信息增强事件到视频重建质量

**关键词**：事件到视频重建, 语义信息增强, 跨模态特征对齐, Segment Anything Model, 事件相机视觉

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：事件相机仅捕捉强度变化，缺乏语义信息，导致事件到视频重建困难。
- 方法要点：使用跨模态特征对齐和语义感知特征融合，从SAM模型迁移语义知识。
- 实验或效果：在多个基准测试中显著提升帧质量，优于现有先进方法。

## 摘要（原文）

> Event cameras offer distinct advantages such as low latency, high dynamic
> range, and efficient motion capture. However, event-to-video reconstruction
> (E2V), a fundamental event-based vision task, remains challenging, particularly
> for reconstructing and recovering semantic information. This is primarily due
> to the nature of the event camera, as it only captures intensity changes,
> ignoring static objects and backgrounds, resulting in a lack of semantic
> information in captured event modality. Further, semantic information plays a
> crucial role in video and frame reconstruction, yet is often overlooked by
> existing E2V approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose Semantic-E2VID, an E2V
> framework that explores the missing visual semantic knowledge in event modality
> and leverages it to enhance event-to-video reconstruction. Specifically,
> Semantic-E2VID introduces a cross-modal feature alignment (CFA) module to
> transfer the robust visual semantics from a frame-based vision foundation
> model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to the event encoder, while aligning
> the high-level features from distinct modalities. To better utilize the learned
> semantic feature, we further propose a semantic-aware feature fusion (SFF)
> block to integrate learned semantics in frame modality to form event
> representations with rich semantics that can be decoded by the event decoder.
> Further, to facilitate the reconstruction of semantic information, we propose a
> novel Semantic Perceptual E2V Supervision that helps the model to reconstruct
> semantic details by leveraging SAM-generated categorical labels. Extensive
> experiments demonstrate that Semantic-E2VID significantly enhances frame
> quality, outperforming state-of-the-art E2V methods across multiple benchmarks.
> The sample code is included in the supplementary material.
