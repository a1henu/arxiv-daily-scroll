## 摘要（原文）

> Recently, significant progress has been made in multi-modal continual
> learning, aiming to learn new tasks sequentially in multi-modal settings while
> preserving performance on previously learned ones. However, existing methods
> mainly focus on coarse-grained tasks, with limitations in addressing modality
> entanglement in fine-grained continual learning settings. To bridge this gap,
> we introduce a novel Continual Audio-Visual Segmentation (CAVS) task, aiming to
> continuously segment new classes guided by audio. Through comprehensive
> analysis, two critical challenges are identified: 1) multi-modal semantic
> drift, where a sounding objects is labeled as background in sequential tasks;
> 2) co-occurrence confusion, where frequent co-occurring classes tend to be
> confused. In this work, a Collision-based Multi-modal Rehearsal (CMR) framework
> is designed to address these challenges. Specifically, for multi-modal semantic
> drift, a Multi-modal Sample Selection (MSS) strategy is proposed to select
> samples with high modal consistency for rehearsal. Meanwhile, for co-occurence
> confusion, a Collision-based Sample Rehearsal (CSR) mechanism is designed,
> allowing for the increase of rehearsal sample frequency of those confusable
> classes during training process. Moreover, we construct three audio-visual
> incremental scenarios to verify effectiveness of our method. Comprehensive
> experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms single-modal
> continual learning methods.
