## 摘要（原文）

> Grey-box methods for system identification combine deep learning with
> physics-informed constraints, capturing complex dependencies while improving
> out-of-distribution generalization. Yet, despite the growing importance of
> floating-base systems such as humanoids and quadrupeds, current grey-box models
> ignore their specific physical constraints. For instance, the inertia matrix is
> not only positive definite but also exhibits branch-induced sparsity and input
> independence. Moreover, the 6x6 composite spatial inertia of the floating base
> inherits properties of single-rigid-body inertia matrices. As we show, this
> includes the triangle inequality on the eigenvalues of the composite rotational
> inertia. To address the lack of physical consistency in deep learning models of
> floating-base systems, we introduce a parameterization of inertia matrices that
> satisfies all these constraints. Inspired by Deep Lagrangian Networks (DeLaN),
> we train neural networks to predict physically plausible inertia matrices that
> minimize inverse dynamics error under Lagrangian mechanics. For evaluation, we
> collected and released a dataset on multiple quadrupeds and humanoids. In these
> experiments, our Floating-Base Deep Lagrangian Networks (FeLaN) achieve highly
> competitive performance on both simulated and real robots, while providing
> greater physical interpretability.
