**关键词**：逆最优控制, 肌肉力分配, 病理步态, 中风康复, 目标函数优化

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：如何确定中风后步态中肌肉力分配的最佳目标函数，以近似神经控制策略。
- 方法要点：使用逆最优控制，从基础目标函数的正线性组合中识别个体和腿部特定的最佳函数。
- 实验效果：模型在各自肢体上表现良好，但跨对象泛化差，尤其对偏瘫腿。

## 摘要（原文）

> Muscle force sharing is typically resolved by minimizing a specific objective
> function to approximate neural control strategies. An inverse optimal control
> approach was applied to identify the "best" objective function, among a
> positive linear combination of basis objective functions, associated with the
> gait of two post-stroke males, one high-functioning (subject S1) and one
> low-functioning (subject S2). It was found that the "best" objective function
> is subject- and leg-specific. No single function works universally well, yet
> the best options are usually differently weighted combinations of muscle
> activation- and power-minimization. Subject-specific inverse optimal control
> models performed best on their respective limbs (\textbf{RMSE 178/213 N, CC
> 0.71/0.61} for non-paretic and paretic legs of S1; \textbf{RMSE 205/165 N, CC
> 0.88/0.85} for respective legs of S2), but cross-subject generalization was
> poor, particularly for paretic legs. Moreover, minimizing the root mean square
> of muscle power emerged as important for paretic limbs, while minimizing
> activation-based functions dominated for non-paretic limbs. This may suggest
> different neural control strategies between affected and unaffected sides,
> possibly altered by the presence of spasticity. Among the 15 considered
> objective functions commonly used in inverse dynamics-based computations, the
> root mean square of muscle power was the only one explicitly incorporating
> muscle velocity, leading to a possible model for spasticity in the paretic
> limbs. Although this objective function has been rarely used, it may be
> relevant for modeling pathological gait, such as post-stroke gait.
