- 方法要点：开发两种实验流程，基于原始图像和壳预处理，探索特征学习策略。
- 实验或效果：原始图像模型性能更高，壳预处理模型显示未来改进潜力。

## 摘要（原文）

> Automated signature verification is a critical biometric technique used in
> banking, identity authentication, and legal documentation. Despite the notable
> progress achieved by deep learning methods, most approaches in offline
> signature verification still struggle to generalize across datasets, as
> variations in handwriting styles and acquisition protocols often degrade
> performance. This study investigates feature learning strategies for signature
> forgery detection, focusing on improving cross-dataset generalization -- that
> is, model robustness when trained on one dataset and tested on another. Using
> three public benchmarks -- CEDAR, ICDAR, and GPDS Synthetic -- two experimental
> pipelines were developed: one based on raw signature images and another
> employing a preprocessing method referred to as shell preprocessing. Several
> behavioral patterns were identified and analyzed; however, no definitive
> superiority between the two approaches was established. The results show that
> the raw-image model achieved higher performance across benchmarks, while the
> shell-based model demonstrated promising potential for future refinement toward
> robust, cross-domain signature verification.
