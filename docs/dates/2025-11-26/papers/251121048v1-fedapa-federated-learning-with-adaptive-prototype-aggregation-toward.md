## 摘要（原文）

> Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI)-based sensing provides a non-invasive, device-free approach for tasks such as human activity recognition and crowd counting, but large-scale deployment is hindered by the need for extensive site-specific training data. Federated learning (FL) offers a way to avoid raw data sharing but is challenged by heterogeneous sensing data and device resources. This paper proposes FedAPA, a collaborative Wi-Fi CSI-based sensing algorithm that uses adaptive prototype aggregation (APA) strategy to assign similarity-based weights to peer prototypes, enabling adaptive client contributions and yielding a personalized global prototype for each client instead of a fixed-weight aggregation. During local training, we adopt a hybrid objective that combines classification learning with representation contrastive learning to align local and global knowledge. We provide a convergence analysis of FedAPA and evaluate it in a real-world distributed Wi-Fi crowd counting scenario with six environments and up to 20 people. The results show that our method outperform multiple baselines in terms of accuracy, F1 score, mean absolute error (MAE), and communication overhead, with FedAPA achieving at least a 9.65% increase in accuracy, a 9% gain in F1 score, a 0.29 reduction in MAE, and a 95.94% reduction in communication overhead.
