**一句话要点**：提出Deceptron模块以加速和稳定物理逆问题求解

**关键词**：逆问题求解, 局部逆学习, 梯度预处理, 物理模拟, 迭代优化

## 3 点简述
- 物理逆问题在输入空间常为病态，导致步长敏感和收敛缓慢
- Deceptron学习局部逆函数，结合多种损失函数训练，用于梯度下降预处理
- 在1D热传导和阻尼振荡器问题中，迭代次数显著减少，性能媲美高斯-牛顿法

## 摘要（原文）

> Inverse problems in the physical sciences are often ill-conditioned in input space, making progress step-size sensitive. We propose the Deceptron, a lightweight bidirectional module that learns a local inverse of a differentiable forward surrogate. Training combines a supervised fit, forward-reverse consistency, a lightweight spectral penalty, a soft bias tie, and a Jacobian Composition Penalty (JCP) that encourages $J_g(f(x))\,J_f(x)\!\approx\!I$ via JVP/VJP probes. At solve time, D-IPG (Deceptron Inverse-Preconditioned Gradient) takes a descent step in output space, pulls it back through $g$, and projects under the same backtracking and stopping rules as baselines. On Heat-1D initial-condition recovery and a Damped Oscillator inverse problem, D-IPG reaches a fixed normalized tolerance with $\sim$20$\times$ fewer iterations on Heat and $\sim$2-3$\times$ fewer on Oscillator than projected gradient, competitive in iterations and cost with Gauss-Newton. Diagnostics show JCP reduces a measured composition error and tracks iteration gains. We also preview a single-scale 2D instantiation, DeceptronNet (v0), that learns few-step corrections under a strict fairness protocol and exhibits notably fast convergence.
