## 摘要（原文）

> Conventional road-situation detection methods achieve strong performance in
> predefined scenarios but fail in unseen cases and lack semantic interpretation,
> which is crucial for reliable traffic recommendations. This work introduces a
> multi-agent AI framework that combines multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
> with vision-based perception for road-situation monitoring. The framework
> processes camera feeds and coordinates dedicated agents for situation
> detection, distance estimation, decision-making, and Cooperative Intelligent
> Transport System (C-ITS) message generation. Evaluation is conducted on a
> custom dataset of 103 images extracted from 20 videos of the TAD dataset. Both
> Gemini-2.0-Flash and Gemini-2.5-Flash were evaluated. The results show 100\%
> recall in situation detection and perfect message schema correctness; however,
> both models suffer from false-positive detections and have reduced performance
> in terms of number of lanes, driving lane status and cause code. Surprisingly,
> Gemini-2.5-Flash, though more capable in general tasks, underperforms
> Gemini-2.0-Flash in detection accuracy and semantic understanding and incurs
> higher latency (Table II). These findings motivate further work on fine-tuning
> specialized LLMs or MLLMs tailored for intelligent transportation applications.
