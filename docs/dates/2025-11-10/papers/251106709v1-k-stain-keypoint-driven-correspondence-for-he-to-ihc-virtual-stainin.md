## 摘要（原文）

> Virtual staining offers a promising method for converting Hematoxylin and
> Eosin (H&E) images into Immunohistochemical (IHC) images, eliminating the need
> for costly chemical processes. However, existing methods often struggle to
> utilize spatial information effectively due to misalignment in tissue slices.
> To overcome this challenge, we leverage keypoints as robust indicators of
> spatial correspondence, enabling more precise alignment and integration of
> structural details in synthesized IHC images. We introduce K-Stain, a novel
> framework that employs keypoint-based spatial and semantic relationships to
> enhance synthesized IHC image fidelity. K-Stain comprises three main
> components: (1) a Hierarchical Spatial Keypoint Detector (HSKD) for identifying
> keypoints in stain images, (2) a Keypoint-aware Enhancement Generator (KEG)
> that integrates these keypoints during image generation, and (3) a Keypoint
> Guided Discriminator (KGD) that improves the discriminator's sensitivity to
> spatial details. Our approach leverages contextual information from adjacent
> slices, resulting in more accurate and visually consistent IHC images.
> Extensive experiments show that K-Stain outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
> quantitative metrics and visual quality.
