## 摘要（原文）

> A simultaneous enhancement of accuracy and diversity of predictions remains a
> challenge in ambiguous medical image segmentation (AMIS) due to the inherent
> trade-offs. While truncated diffusion probabilistic models (TDPMs) hold strong
> potential with a paradigm optimization, existing TDPMs suffer from entangled
> accuracy and diversity of predictions with insufficient fidelity and
> plausibility. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose
> Ambiguity-aware Truncated Flow Matching (ATFM), which introduces a novel
> inference paradigm and dedicated model components. Firstly, we propose
> Data-Hierarchical Inference, a redefinition of AMIS-specific inference
> paradigm, which enhances accuracy and diversity at data-distribution and
> data-sample level, respectively, for an effective disentanglement. Secondly,
> Gaussian Truncation Representation (GTR) is introduced to enhance both fidelity
> of predictions and reliability of truncation distribution, by explicitly
> modeling it as a Gaussian distribution at $T_{\text{trunc}}$ instead of using
> sampling-based approximations.Thirdly, Segmentation Flow Matching (SFM) is
> proposed to enhance the plausibility of diverse predictions by extending
> semantic-aware flow transformation in Flow Matching (FM). Comprehensive
> evaluations on LIDC and ISIC3 datasets demonstrate that ATFM outperforms SOTA
> methods and simultaneously achieves a more efficient inference. ATFM improves
> GED and HM-IoU by up to $12\%$ and $7.3\%$ compared to advanced methods.
