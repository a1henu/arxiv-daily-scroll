## 摘要（原文）

> 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enhances 3D scene reconstruction through
> explicit representation and fast rendering, demonstrating potential benefits
> for various low-level vision tasks, including video compression. However,
> existing 3DGS-based video codecs generally exhibit more noticeable visual
> artifacts and relatively low compression ratios. In this paper, we specifically
> target the perceptual enhancement of 3DGS-based video compression, based on the
> assumption that artifacts from 3DGS rendering and quantization resemble noisy
> latents sampled during diffusion training. Building on this premise, we propose
> a content-adaptive framework, GFix, comprising a streamlined, single-step
> diffusion model that serves as an off-the-shelf neural enhancer. Moreover, to
> increase compression efficiency, We propose a modulated LoRA scheme that
> freezes the low-rank decompositions and modulates the intermediate hidden
> states, thereby achieving efficient adaptation of the diffusion backbone with
> highly compressible updates. Experimental results show that GFix delivers
> strong perceptual quality enhancement, outperforming GSVC with up to 72.1%
> BD-rate savings in LPIPS and 21.4% in FID.
