## 摘要（原文）

> \textit{Implicit neural representations} (INRs) have emerged as a promising
> framework for representing signals in low-dimensional spaces. This survey
> reviews the existing literature on the specialized INR problem of approximating
> \textit{signed distance functions} (SDFs) for surface scenes, using either
> oriented point clouds or a set of posed images. We refer to neural SDFs that
> incorporate differential geometry tools, such as normals and curvatures, in
> their loss functions as \textit{geometric} INRs. The key idea behind this 3D
> reconstruction approach is to include additional \textit{regularization} terms
> in the loss function, ensuring that the INR satisfies certain global properties
> that the function should hold -- such as having unit gradient in the case of
> SDFs. We explore key methodological components, including the definition of
> INR, the construction of geometric loss functions, and sampling schemes from a
> differential geometry perspective. Our review highlights the significant
> advancements enabled by geometric INRs in surface reconstruction from oriented
> point clouds and posed images.
