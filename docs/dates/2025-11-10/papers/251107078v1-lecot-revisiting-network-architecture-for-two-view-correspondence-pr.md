- 实验效果：在多个任务中优于现有方法，包括对应点修剪和3D重建。

## 摘要（原文）

> Two-view correspondence pruning aims to accurately remove incorrect
> correspondences (outliers) from initial ones and is widely applied to various
> computer vision tasks. Current popular strategies adopt multilayer perceptron
> (MLP) as the backbone, supplemented by additional modules to enhance the
> network ability to handle context information, which is a known limitation of
> MLPs. In contrast, we introduce a novel perspective for capturing
> correspondence context information without extra design modules. To this end,
> we design a two-view correspondence pruning network called LeCoT, which can
> naturally leverage global context information at different stages.
> Specifically, the core design of LeCoT is the Spatial-Channel Fusion
> Transformer block, a newly proposed component that efficiently utilizes both
> spatial and channel global context information among sparse correspondences. In
> addition, we integrate the proposed prediction block that utilizes
> correspondence features from intermediate stages to generate a probability set,
> which acts as guiding information for subsequent learning phases, allowing the
> network to more effectively capture robust global context information. Notably,
> this prediction block progressively refines the probability set, thereby
> mitigating the issue of information loss that is common in the traditional one.
> Extensive experiments prove that the proposed LeCoT outperforms
> state-of-the-art methods in correspondence pruning, relative pose estimation,
> homography estimation, visual localization, and $3$D~reconstruction tasks. The
> code is provided in
