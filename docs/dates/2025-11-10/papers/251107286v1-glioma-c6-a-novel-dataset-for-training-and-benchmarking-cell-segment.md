**一句话要点**：提出Glioma C6数据集以支持胶质瘤细胞实例分割的训练与基准测试

**关键词**：实例分割, 胶质瘤细胞, 生物医学图像分析, 深度学习基准, 细胞形态分类

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：缺乏用于胶质瘤C6细胞实例分割的开放数据集，限制深度学习模型开发。
- 方法要点：提供75张高分辨率图像和超1.2万个细胞标注，包括体细胞注释和形态分类。
- 实验或效果：训练模型显著提升分割性能，验证数据集对鲁棒和泛化模型的价值。

## 摘要（原文）

> We present Glioma C6, a new open dataset for instance segmentation of glioma
> C6 cells, designed as both a benchmark and a training resource for deep
> learning models. The dataset comprises 75 high-resolution phase-contrast
> microscopy images with over 12,000 annotated cells, providing a realistic
> testbed for biomedical image analysis. It includes soma annotations and
> morphological cell categorization provided by biologists. Additional
> categorization of cells, based on morphology, aims to enhance the utilization
> of image data for cancer cell research. Glioma C6 consists of two parts: the
> first is curated with controlled parameters for benchmarking, while the second
> supports generalization testing under varying conditions. We evaluate the
> performance of several generalist segmentation models, highlighting their
> limitations on our dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that training on Glioma
> C6 significantly enhances segmentation performance, reinforcing its value for
> developing robust and generalizable models. The dataset is publicly available
> for researchers.
