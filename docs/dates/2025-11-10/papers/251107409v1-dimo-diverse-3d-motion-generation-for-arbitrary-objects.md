## 摘要（原文）

> We present DIMO, a generative approach capable of generating diverse 3D
> motions for arbitrary objects from a single image. The core idea of our work is
> to leverage the rich priors in well-trained video models to extract the common
> motion patterns and then embed them into a shared low-dimensional latent space.
> Specifically, we first generate multiple videos of the same object with diverse
> motions. We then embed each motion into a latent vector and train a shared
> motion decoder to learn the distribution of motions represented by a structured
> and compact motion representation, i.e., neural key point trajectories. The
> canonical 3D Gaussians are then driven by these key points and fused to model
> the geometry and appearance. During inference time with learned latent space,
> we can instantly sample diverse 3D motions in a single-forward pass and support
> several interesting applications including 3D motion interpolation and
> language-guided motion generation. Our project page is available at
