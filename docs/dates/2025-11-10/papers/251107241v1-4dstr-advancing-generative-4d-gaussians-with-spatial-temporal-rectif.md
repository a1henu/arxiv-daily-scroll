## 摘要（原文）

> Remarkable advances in recent 2D image and 3D shape generation have induced a
> significant focus on dynamic 4D content generation. However, previous 4D
> generation methods commonly struggle to maintain spatial-temporal consistency
> and adapt poorly to rapid temporal variations, due to the lack of effective
> spatial-temporal modeling. To address these problems, we propose a novel 4D
> generation network called 4DSTR, which modulates generative 4D Gaussian
> Splatting with spatial-temporal rectification. Specifically, temporal
> correlation across generated 4D sequences is designed to rectify deformable
> scales and rotations and guarantee temporal consistency. Furthermore, an
> adaptive spatial densification and pruning strategy is proposed to address
> significant temporal variations by dynamically adding or deleting Gaussian
> points with the awareness of their pre-frame movements. Extensive experiments
> demonstrate that our 4DSTR achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-4D
> generation, excelling in reconstruction quality, spatial-temporal consistency,
> and adaptation to rapid temporal movements.
