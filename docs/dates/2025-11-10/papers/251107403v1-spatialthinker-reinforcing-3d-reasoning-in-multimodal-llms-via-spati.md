**一句话要点**：提出SpatialThinker以增强多模态大语言模型的三维空间推理能力

**关键词**：多模态大语言模型, 三维空间推理, 强化学习, 空间奖励, 场景图构建, 视觉问答

## 3 点简述

- 通过构建场景图和密集空间奖励，结合强化学习实现结构化空间接地与多步推理
- 在空间理解和真实世界VQA基准上超越基线模型和GPT-4o，提升基础模型增益

## 摘要（原文）

> Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
> vision-language tasks, but they continue to struggle with spatial
> understanding. Existing spatial MLLMs often rely on explicit 3D inputs or
> architecture-specific modifications, and remain constrained by large-scale
> datasets or sparse supervision. To address these limitations, we introduce
> SpatialThinker, a 3D-aware MLLM trained with RL to integrate structured spatial
> grounding with multi-step reasoning. The model simulates human-like spatial
> perception by constructing a scene graph of task-relevant objects and spatial
> relations, and reasoning towards an answer via dense spatial rewards.
> SpatialThinker consists of two key contributions: (1) a data synthesis pipeline
> that generates STVQA-7K, a high-quality spatial VQA dataset, and (2) online RL
> with a multi-objective dense spatial reward enforcing spatial grounding.
> SpatialThinker-7B outperforms supervised fine-tuning and the sparse RL baseline
> on spatial understanding and real-world VQA benchmarks, nearly doubling the
> base-model gain compared to sparse RL, and surpassing GPT-4o. These results
> showcase the effectiveness of combining spatial supervision with reward-aligned
> reasoning in enabling robust 3D spatial understanding with limited data and
> advancing MLLMs towards human-level visual reasoning.
