## 摘要（原文）

> Claims that humanoid robots achieve ``human-level'' actuation are common but
> rarely quantified. Peak torque or speed specifications tell us little about
> whether a joint can deliver the right combination of torque, power, and
> endurance at task-relevant postures and rates. We introduce a comprehensive
> framework that makes ``human-level'' measurable and comparable across systems.
> Our approach has three components. First, a kinematic \emph{DoF atlas}
> standardizes joint coordinate systems and ranges of motion using ISB-based
> conventions, ensuring that human and robot joints are compared in the same
> reference frames. Second, \emph{Human-Equivalence Envelopes (HEE)} define
> per-joint requirements by measuring whether a robot meets human torque
> \emph{and} power simultaneously at the same joint angle and rate $(q,\omega)$,
> weighted by positive mechanical work in task-specific bands (walking, stairs,
> lifting, reaching, and hand actions). Third, the \emph{Human-Level Actuation
> Score (HLAS)} aggregates six physically grounded factors: workspace coverage
> (ROM and DoF), HEE coverage, torque-mode bandwidth, efficiency, and thermal
> sustainability. We provide detailed measurement protocols using dynamometry,
> electrical power monitoring, and thermal testing that yield every HLAS input
> from reproducible experiments. A worked example demonstrates HLAS computation
> for a multi-joint humanoid, showing how the score exposes actuator trade-offs
> (gearing ratio versus bandwidth and efficiency) that peak-torque specifications
> obscure. The framework serves as both a design specification for humanoid
> development and a benchmarking standard for comparing actuation systems, with
> all components grounded in published human biomechanics data.
