## 摘要（原文）

> Infrared imagery enables temperature-based scene understanding using passive
> sensors, particularly under conditions of low visibility where traditional RGB
> imaging fails. Yet, developing downstream vision models for infrared
> applications is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data, due to
> the specialized expertise required for infrared annotation. While synthetic
> infrared image generation has the potential to accelerate model development by
> providing large-scale, diverse training data, training foundation-level
> generative diffusion models in the infrared domain has remained elusive due to
> limited datasets. In light of such data constraints, we explore an
> inference-time scaling approach using a domain-adapted CLIP-based verifier for
> enhanced infrared image generation quality. We adapt FLUX.1-dev, a
> state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model, to the infrared domain by
> finetuning it on a small sample of infrared images using parameter-efficient
> techniques. The trained verifier is then employed during inference to guide the
> diffusion sampling process toward higher quality infrared generations that
> better align with input text prompts. Empirically, we find that our approach
> leads to consistent improvements in generation quality, reducing FID scores on
> the KAIST Multispectral Pedestrian Detection Benchmark dataset by 10% compared
> to unguided baseline samples. Our results suggest that inference-time guidance
> offers a promising direction for bridging the domain gap in low-data infrared
> settings.
