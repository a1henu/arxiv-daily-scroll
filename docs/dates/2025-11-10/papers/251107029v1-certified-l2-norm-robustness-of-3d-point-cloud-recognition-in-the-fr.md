## 摘要（原文）

> 3D point cloud classification is a fundamental task in safety-critical
> applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality.
> However, recent studies reveal that point cloud classifiers are vulnerable to
> structured adversarial perturbations and geometric corruptions, posing risks to
> their deployment in safety-critical scenarios. Existing certified defenses
> limit point-wise perturbations but overlook subtle geometric distortions that
> preserve individual points yet alter the overall structure, potentially leading
> to misclassification. In this work, we propose FreqCert, a novel certification
> framework that departs from conventional spatial domain defenses by shifting
> robustness analysis to the frequency domain, enabling structured certification
> against global L2-bounded perturbations. FreqCert first transforms the input
> point cloud via the graph Fourier transform (GFT), then applies structured
> frequency-aware subsampling to generate multiple sub-point clouds. Each
> sub-cloud is independently classified by a standard model, and the final
> prediction is obtained through majority voting, where sub-clouds are
> constructed based on spectral similarity rather than spatial proximity, making
> the partitioning more stable under L2 perturbations and better aligned with the
> object's intrinsic structure. We derive a closed-form lower bound on the
> certified L2 robustness radius and prove its tightness under minimal and
> interpretable assumptions, establishing a theoretical foundation for frequency
> domain certification. Extensive experiments on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN
> datasets demonstrate that FreqCert consistently achieves higher certified
> accuracy and empirical accuracy under strong perturbations. Our results suggest
> that spectral representations provide an effective pathway toward certifiable
> robustness in 3D point cloud recognition.
