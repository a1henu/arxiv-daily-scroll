## 摘要（原文）

> In autonomous driving and robotics, ensuring road safety and reliable
> decision-making critically depends on out-of-distribution (OOD) segmentation.
> While numerous methods have been proposed to detect anomalous objects on the
> road, leveraging the vision-language space-which provides rich linguistic
> knowledge-remains an underexplored field. We hypothesize that incorporating
> these linguistic cues can be especially beneficial in the complex contexts
> found in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.
>   To this end, we present a novel approach that trains a Text-Driven OOD
> Segmentation model to learn a semantically diverse set of objects in the
> vision-language space. Concretely, our approach combines a vision-language
> model's encoder with a transformer decoder, employs Distance-Based OOD prompts
> located at varying semantic distances from in-distribution (ID) classes, and
> utilizes OOD Semantic Augmentation for OOD representations. By aligning visual
> and textual information, our approach effectively generalizes to unseen objects
> and provides robust OOD segmentation in diverse driving environments.
>   We conduct extensive experiments on publicly available OOD segmentation
> datasets such as Fishyscapes, Segment-Me-If-You-Can, and Road Anomaly datasets,
> demonstrating that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across
> both pixel-level and object-level evaluations. This result underscores the
> potential of vision-language-based OOD segmentation to bolster the safety and
> reliability of future autonomous driving systems.
