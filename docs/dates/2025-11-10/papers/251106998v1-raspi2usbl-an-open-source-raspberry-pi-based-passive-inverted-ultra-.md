## 摘要（原文）

> Precise underwater positioning remains a fundamental challenge for underwater
> robotics since global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals cannot
> penetrate the sea surface. This paper presents Raspi$^2$USBL, an open-source,
> Raspberry Pi-based passive inverted ultra-short baseline (piUSBL) positioning
> system designed to provide a low-cost and accessible solution for underwater
> robotic research. The system comprises a passive acoustic receiver and an
> active beacon. The receiver adopts a modular hardware architecture that
> integrates a hydrophone array, a multichannel preamplifier, an oven-controlled
> crystal oscillator (OCXO), a Raspberry Pi 5, and an MCC-series data acquisition
> (DAQ) board. Apart from the Pi 5, OCXO, and MCC board, the beacon comprises an
> impedance-matching network, a power amplifier, and a transmitting transducer.
> An open-source C++ software framework provides high-precision clock
> synchronization and triggering for one-way travel-time (OWTT) messaging, while
> performing real-time signal processing, including matched filtering, array
> beamforming, and adaptive gain control, to estimate the time of flight (TOF)
> and direction of arrival (DOA) of received signals. The Raspi$^2$USBL system
> was experimentally validated in an anechoic tank, freshwater lake, and open-sea
> trials. Results demonstrate a slant-range accuracy better than 0.1%, a bearing
> accuracy within 0.1$^\circ$, and stable performance over operational distances
> up to 1.3 km. These findings confirm that low-cost, reproducible hardware can
> deliver research-grade underwater positioning accuracy. By releasing both the
> hardware and software as open-source, Raspi$^2$USBL provides a unified
> reference platform that lowers the entry barrier for underwater robotics
> laboratories, fosters reproducibility, and promotes collaborative innovation in
> underwater acoustic navigation and swarm robotics.
