## 摘要（原文）

> Whole-slide images are central to digital pathology, yet their extreme size
> and scarce annotations make self-supervised learning essential. Masked
> Autoencoders (MAEs) with Vision Transformer backbones have recently shown
> strong potential for histopathology representation learning. However,
> conventional random patch sampling during MAE pretraining often includes
> irrelevant or noisy regions, limiting the model's ability to capture meaningful
> tissue patterns. In this paper, we present a lightweight and domain-adapted
> framework that brings structure and biological relevance into MAE-based
> learning through a wavelet-informed patch selection strategy. WISE-MAE applies
> a two-step coarse-to-fine process: wavelet-based screening at low magnification
> to locate structurally rich regions, followed by high-resolution extraction for
> detailed modeling. This approach mirrors the diagnostic workflow of
> pathologists and improves the quality of learned representations. Evaluations
> across multiple cancer datasets, including lung, renal, and colorectal tissues,
> show that WISE-MAE achieves competitive representation quality and downstream
> classification performance while maintaining efficiency under weak supervision.
