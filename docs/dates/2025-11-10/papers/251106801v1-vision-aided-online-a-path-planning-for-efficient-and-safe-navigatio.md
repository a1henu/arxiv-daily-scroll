## 摘要（原文）

> The deployment of autonomous service robots in human-centric environments is
> hindered by a critical gap in perception and planning. Traditional navigation
> systems rely on expensive LiDARs that, while geometrically precise, are seman-
> tically unaware, they cannot distinguish a important document on an office
> floor from a harmless piece of litter, treating both as physically traversable.
> While advanced semantic segmentation exists, no prior work has successfully
> integrated this visual intelligence into a real-time path planner that is
> efficient enough for low-cost, embedded hardware. This paper presents a frame-
> work to bridge this gap, delivering context-aware navigation on an affordable
> robotic platform. Our approach centers on a novel, tight integration of a
> lightweight perception module with an online A* planner. The perception system
> employs a semantic segmentation model to identify user-defined visual
> constraints, enabling the robot to navigate based on contextual importance
> rather than physical size alone. This adaptability allows an operator to define
> what is critical for a given task, be it sensitive papers in an office or
> safety lines in a factory, thus resolving the ambiguity of what to avoid. This
> semantic perception is seamlessly fused with geometric data. The identified
> visual constraints are projected as non-geometric obstacles onto a global map
> that is continuously updated from sensor data, enabling robust navigation
> through both partially known and unknown environments. We validate our
> framework through extensive experiments in high-fidelity simulations and on a
> real-world robotic platform. The results demonstrate robust, real-time
> performance, proving that a cost- effective robot can safely navigate complex
> environments while respecting critical visual cues invisible to traditional
> planners.
