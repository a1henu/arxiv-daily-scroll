**一句话要点**：提出AnoStyler以解决零样本异常生成中视觉真实性和资源依赖问题

**关键词**：异常生成, 风格迁移, 零样本学习, 轻量模型, 文本引导, 局部异常

## 3 点简述
- 现有异常生成方法存在视觉不真实、依赖大量真实图像或模型笨重的问题
- 使用文本引导风格迁移，基于单张正常图像和文本提示生成局部异常
- 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上验证，生成高质量异常图像并提升检测性能

## 摘要（原文）

> Anomaly generation has been widely explored to address the scarcity of
> anomaly images in real-world data. However, existing methods typically suffer
> from at least one of the following limitations, hindering their practical
> deployment: (1) lack of visual realism in generated anomalies; (2) dependence
> on large amounts of real images; and (3) use of memory-intensive, heavyweight
> model architectures. To overcome these limitations, we propose AnoStyler, a
> lightweight yet effective method that frames zero-shot anomaly generation as
> text-guided style transfer. Given a single normal image along with its category
> label and expected defect type, an anomaly mask indicating the localized
> anomaly regions and two-class text prompts representing the normal and anomaly
> states are generated using generalizable category-agnostic procedures. A
> lightweight U-Net model trained with CLIP-based loss functions is used to
> stylize the normal image into a visually realistic anomaly image, where
> anomalies are localized by the anomaly mask and semantically aligned with the
> text prompts. Extensive experiments on the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets show that
> AnoStyler outperforms existing anomaly generation methods in generating
> high-quality and diverse anomaly images. Furthermore, using these generated
> anomalies helps enhance anomaly detection performance.
