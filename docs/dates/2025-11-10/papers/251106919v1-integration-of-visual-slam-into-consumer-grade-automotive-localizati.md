## 摘要（原文）

> Accurate ego-motion estimation in consumer-grade vehicles currently relies on
> proprioceptive sensors, i.e. wheel odometry and IMUs, whose performance is
> limited by systematic errors and calibration. While visual-inertial SLAM has
> become a standard in robotics, its integration into automotive ego-motion
> estimation remains largely unexplored. This paper investigates how visual SLAM
> can be integrated into consumer-grade vehicle localization systems to improve
> performance. We propose a framework that fuses visual SLAM with a lateral
> vehicle dynamics model to achieve online gyroscope calibration under realistic
> driving conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that vision-based
> integration significantly improves gyroscope calibration accuracy and thus
> enhances overall localization performance, highlighting a promising path toward
> higher automotive localization accuracy. We provide results on both proprietary
> and public datasets, showing improved performance and superior localization
> accuracy on a public benchmark compared to state-of-the-art methods.
