## 摘要（原文）

> Circular targets are widely used in LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration due to
> their geometric consistency and ease of detection. However, achieving accurate
> 3D-2D circular center correspondence remains challenging. Existing methods
> often fail due to decoupled 3D fitting and erroneous 2D ellipse-center
> estimation. To address this, we propose a geometrically principled framework
> featuring two innovations: (i) a robust 3D circle center estimator based on
> conformal geometric algebra and RANSAC; and (ii) a chord-length variance
> minimization method to recover the true 2D projected center, resolving its
> dual-minima ambi- guity via homography validation or a quasi-RANSAC fallback.
> Evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets, our framework significantly
> outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. It reduces extrinsic estimation error
> and enables robust calibration across diverse sensors and target types,
> including natural circular objects. Our code will be publicly released for
> reproducibility.
