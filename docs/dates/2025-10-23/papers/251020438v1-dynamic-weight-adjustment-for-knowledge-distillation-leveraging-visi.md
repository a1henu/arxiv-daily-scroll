## 摘要（原文）

> This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for
> lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven
> knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease
> diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,
> our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,
> enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing
> attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model
> ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC
> images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,
> which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,
> enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is
> further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the
> training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image
> quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as
> Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and
> Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution
> and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to
> standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale
> frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for
> better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic
> Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model
> from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational
> cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000
> histopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images
> (99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.
