**关键词**：四足机器人, 模型预测控制, 强化学习, 步态自适应, 能耗优化, 实时控制

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：模型无关强化学习易收敛到单一步态，模型预测控制难以适应环境变化。
- 方法要点：在连续步态空间中，MPPI联合优化动作与步态变量，使用Dreamer奖励函数。
- 实验效果：在Unitree Go1仿真中，能耗平均降低36.48%，保持准确跟踪与自适应步态。

## 摘要（原文）

> Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled adaptable and agile
> quadruped locomotion; however, policies often converge to a single gait,
> leading to suboptimal performance. Traditionally, Model Predictive Control
> (MPC) has been extensively used to obtain task-specific optimal policies but
> lacks the ability to adapt to varying environments. To address these
> limitations, we propose an optimization framework for real-time gait adaptation
> in a continuous gait space, combining the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI)
> algorithm with a Dreamer module to produce adaptive and optimal policies for
> quadruped locomotion. At each time step, MPPI jointly optimizes the actions and
> gait variables using a learned Dreamer reward that promotes velocity tracking,
> energy efficiency, stability, and smooth transitions, while penalizing abrupt
> gait changes. A learned value function is incorporated as terminal reward,
> extending the formulation to an infinite-horizon planner. We evaluate our
> framework in simulation on the Unitree Go1, demonstrating an average reduction
> of up to 36.48\% in energy consumption across varying target speeds, while
> maintaining accurate tracking and adaptive, task-appropriate gaits.
