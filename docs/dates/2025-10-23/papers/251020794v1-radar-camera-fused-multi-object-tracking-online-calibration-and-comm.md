## 摘要（原文）

> This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar
> and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual
> interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a
> supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth
> information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions
> radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to
> enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and
> camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a
> radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration
> to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2)
> the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately
> derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of
> feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations
> of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best
> of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of
> radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving
> MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline
> the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced
> by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual
> traffic scenarios. Code is available at
