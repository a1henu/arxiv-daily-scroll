## 摘要（原文）

> Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without
> indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3
> have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet
> extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint
> temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce
> Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal
> evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design
> training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model
> highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers,
> allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable
> this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets,
> STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed
> temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either
> temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified
> spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start
> reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that
> jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.
> On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance,
> raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent
> improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding
> benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond
> accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable
> signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and
> improving answer reliability.
