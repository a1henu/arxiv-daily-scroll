**一句话要点**：提出RAPO++框架以优化文本到视频生成的提示设计

**关键词**：提示优化, 文本到视频生成, 数据对齐, 测试时缩放, LLM微调, 跨阶段框架

## 3 点简述
- 用户提示短小且与训练数据不匹配，限制扩散模型生成潜力。
- 方法包括数据对齐优化、测试时迭代缩放和LLM微调，无需修改生成主干。
- 实验在多个模型和基准上显示语义对齐、组合推理等指标显著提升。

## 摘要（原文）

> Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet
> user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with
> training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models.
> We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that
> unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and
> large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation
> without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1},
> Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with
> semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors
> them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and
> multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt
> Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts
> using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity,
> temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding
> progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages
> optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing
> task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt
> generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five
> state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++
> achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning,
> temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods
> by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic,
> cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt
> optimization in T2V generation. The code is available at
