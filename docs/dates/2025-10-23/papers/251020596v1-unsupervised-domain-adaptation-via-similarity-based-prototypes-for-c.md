## 摘要（原文）

> Deep learning models have achieved great success on various vision
> challenges, but a well-trained model would face drastic performance degradation
> when applied to unseen data. Since the model is sensitive to domain shift,
> unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid
> costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for
> cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we
> learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a
> similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic
> class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to
> store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the
> class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and
> further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method
> achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.
