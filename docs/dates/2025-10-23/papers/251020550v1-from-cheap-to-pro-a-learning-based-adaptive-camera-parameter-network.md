## 摘要（原文）

> Consumer-grade camera systems often struggle to maintain stable image quality
> under complex illumination conditions such as low light, high dynamic range,
> and backlighting, as well as spatial color temperature variation. These issues
> lead to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency, which degrade the
> performance of downstream vision tasks. To address this, we propose
> ACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment
> network that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW
> inputs. The framework consists of two modules: ACamera-Exposure, which
> estimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color,
> which predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color
> consistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can
> be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines. Trained on diverse real-world
> data with annotated references, the model generalizes well across lighting
> conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACamera-Net consistently
> enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming
> conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines without relying on additional
> image enhancement modules.
