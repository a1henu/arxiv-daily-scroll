## 摘要（原文）

> In this paper the computational challenges of time-optimal path following are

> inevitably leads to singularities at zero path speed, when reformulating the
> optimization problem in terms of a path parameter. Thus, smooth trajectory
> generation while maintaining a low computational effort is quite challenging,
> since the singularities have to be taken into account. To this end, a different
> approach is presented in this paper. This approach is based on maximizing the
> path speed along a prescribed path. Furthermore, the approach is capable of
> planning smooth trajectories numerically efficient. Moreover, the discrete
> reformulation of the underlying problem is linear in optimization variables.
