## 摘要（原文）

> Grasping accuracy is a critical prerequisite for precise object manipulation,
> often requiring careful alignment between the robot hand and object. Neural
> Descriptor Fields (NDF) offer a promising vision-based method to generate
> grasping poses that generalize across object categories. However, NDF alone can
> produce inaccurate poses due to imperfect camera calibration, incomplete point
> clouds, and object variability. Meanwhile, tactile sensing enables more precise
> contact, but existing approaches typically learn policies limited to simple,
> predefined contact geometries. In this work, we introduce NeuralTouch, a
> multimodal framework that integrates NDF and tactile sensing to enable
> accurate, generalizable grasping through gentle physical interaction. Our
> approach leverages NDF to implicitly represent the target contact geometry,
> from which a deep reinforcement learning (RL) policy is trained to refine the
> grasp using tactile feedback. This policy is conditioned on the neural
> descriptors and does not require explicit specification of contact types. We
> validate NeuralTouch through ablation studies in simulation and zero-shot
> transfer to real-world manipulation tasks--such as peg-out-in-hole and bottle
> lid opening--without additional fine-tuning. Results show that NeuralTouch
> significantly improves grasping accuracy and robustness over baseline methods,
> offering a general framework for precise, contact-rich robotic manipulation.
