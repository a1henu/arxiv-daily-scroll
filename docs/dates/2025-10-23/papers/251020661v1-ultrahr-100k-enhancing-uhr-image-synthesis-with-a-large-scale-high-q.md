## 摘要（原文）

> Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable
> progress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale
> high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training
> strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the
> first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of
> 100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual
> fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on
> detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the
> second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that
> enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we
> design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning
> on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency
> Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to
> softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail
> preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks
> demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail
> quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation. The code is available at
> \href{https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/UltraHR-100k}{here}.
