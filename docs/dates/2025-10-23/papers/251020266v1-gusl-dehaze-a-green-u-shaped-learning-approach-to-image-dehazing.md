## 摘要（原文）

> Image dehazing is a restoration task that aims to recover a clear image from
> a single hazy input. Traditional approaches rely on statistical priors and the
> physics-based atmospheric scattering model to reconstruct the haze-free image.
> While recent state-of-the-art methods are predominantly based on deep learning
> architectures, these models often involve high computational costs and large
> parameter sizes, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained devices. In
> this work, we propose GUSL-Dehaze, a Green U-Shaped Learning approach to image
> dehazing. Our method integrates a physics-based model with a green learning
> (GL) framework, offering a lightweight, transparent alternative to conventional
> deep learning techniques. Unlike neural network-based solutions, GUSL-Dehaze
> completely avoids deep learning. Instead, we begin with an initial dehazing
> step using a modified Dark Channel Prior (DCP), which is followed by a green
> learning pipeline implemented through a U-shaped architecture. This
> architecture employs unsupervised representation learning for effective feature
> extraction, together with feature-engineering techniques such as the Relevant
> Feature Test (RFT) and the Least-Squares Normal Transform (LNT) to maintain a
> compact model size. Finally, the dehazed image is obtained via a transparent
> supervised learning strategy. GUSL-Dehaze significantly reduces parameter count
> while ensuring mathematical interpretability and achieving performance on par
> with state-of-the-art deep learning models.
