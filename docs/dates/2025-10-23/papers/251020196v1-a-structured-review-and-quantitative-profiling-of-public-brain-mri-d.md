## 摘要（原文）

> The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the
> scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments
> of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly
> accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a
> structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At
> the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and
> dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
> smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
> orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
> demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
> learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
> variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
> skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
> and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
> differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
> 3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
> preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
> inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
> of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
> preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
> generalizable brain MRI foundation models.
