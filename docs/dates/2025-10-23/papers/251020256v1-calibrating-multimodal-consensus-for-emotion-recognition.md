## 摘要（原文）

> In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
> progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
> inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
> cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
> dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
> which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
> propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
> Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
> enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
> Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
> multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
> process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
> CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
> across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
> exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
> CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible
> at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CMC.
