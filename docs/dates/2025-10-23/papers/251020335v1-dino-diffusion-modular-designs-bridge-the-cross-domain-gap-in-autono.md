## 摘要（原文）

> Parking is a critical pillar of driving safety. While recent end-to-end (E2E)
> approaches have achieved promising in-domain results, robustness under domain
> shifts (e.g., weather and lighting changes) remains a key challenge. Rather
> than relying on additional data, in this paper, we propose Dino-Diffusion
> Parking (DDP), a domain-agnostic autonomous parking pipeline that integrates
> visual foundation models with diffusion-based planning to enable generalized
> perception and robust motion planning under distribution shifts. We train our
> pipeline in CARLA at regular setting and transfer it to more adversarial
> settings in a zero-shot fashion. Our model consistently achieves a parking
> success rate above 90% across all tested out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios,
> with ablation studies confirming that both the network architecture and
> algorithmic design significantly enhance cross-domain performance over existing
> baselines. Furthermore, testing in a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) environment
> reconstructed from a real-world parking lot demonstrates promising sim-to-real
> transfer.
