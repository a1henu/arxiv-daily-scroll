## 摘要（原文）

> Despite advancements in SLAM technologies, robust operation under challenging
> conditions such as low-texture, motion-blur, or challenging lighting remains an
> open challenge. Such conditions are common in applications such as assistive
> navigation for the visually impaired. These challenges undermine localization
> accuracy and tracking stability, reducing navigation reliability and safety. To
> overcome these limitations, we present SELM-SLAM3, a deep learning-enhanced
> visual SLAM framework that integrates SuperPoint and LightGlue for robust
> feature extraction and matching. We evaluated our framework using TUM RGB-D,
> ICL-NUIM, and TartanAir datasets, which feature diverse and challenging
> scenarios. SELM-SLAM3 outperforms conventional ORB-SLAM3 by an average of
> 87.84% and exceeds state-of-the-art RGB-D SLAM systems by 36.77%. Our framework
> demonstrates enhanced performance under challenging conditions, such as
> low-texture scenes and fast motion, providing a reliable platform for
> developing navigation aids for the visually impaired.
