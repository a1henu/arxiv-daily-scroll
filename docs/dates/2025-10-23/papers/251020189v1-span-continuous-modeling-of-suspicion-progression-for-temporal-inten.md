**一句话要点**：提出SPAN网络以连续建模可疑意图，提升视频监控的早期检测能力

**关键词**：时序意图定位, 连续回归建模, 可疑意图分析, 视频监控, 时序点过程

## 3 点简述
- 现有离散分类方法无法捕捉可疑意图的连续变化，限制早期干预和可解释性
- SPAN采用连续回归方法，结合时序点过程理论建模长期依赖和累积效应
- 在HAI数据集上，SPAN显著降低MSE 19.8%，提升mAP 1.78%，尤其在低频场景表现优异

## 摘要（原文）

> Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance,
> focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve
> security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to
> capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early
> intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion
> Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification
> to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving
> suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies
> and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based
> on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous
> changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce
> Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using
> multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.
> Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link
> suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into
> both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive
> experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms
> existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.
> Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating
> its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete
> classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables
> earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system
> explainability and practical utility in security applications.
