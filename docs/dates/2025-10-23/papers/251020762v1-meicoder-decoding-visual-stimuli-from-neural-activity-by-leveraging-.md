## 摘要（原文）

> Decoding visual stimuli from neural population activity is crucial for
> understanding the brain and for applications in brain-machine interfaces.
> However, such biological data is often scarce, particularly in primates or
> humans, where high-throughput recording techniques, such as two-photon imaging,
> remain challenging or impossible to apply. This, in turn, poses a challenge for
> deep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a
> biologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most
> exciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and
> adversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in
> reconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual
> cortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded
> neurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers
> of the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can
> reconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500
> neurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified
> benchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results
> demonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and
> provide practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.
