## 摘要（原文）

> Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR)
> image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma
> under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting,
> optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is
> motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features
> inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are
> insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we
> introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework
> built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The
> first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary
> processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding
> network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A
> subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a
> final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head
> with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative
> embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer
> (0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that
> KINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition,
> offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution
> scenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective
> solution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy
> AI in SAR image analysis.
