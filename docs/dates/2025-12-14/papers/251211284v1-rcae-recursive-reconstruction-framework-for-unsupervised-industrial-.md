**关键词**：无监督异常检测, 工业视觉, 递归自编码器, 渐进重建, 细节保留, 高效推理

## 3 点简述
- 传统自编码器单次解码难以有效处理不同严重程度和尺度的异常，导致异常抑制不完整和细节丢失
- RcAE采用递归架构迭代重建，逐步抑制异常并细化正常结构，结合跨递归检测模块和细节保留网络提升检测能力
- 实验表明该方法显著优于现有非扩散方法，性能与扩散模型相当但参数量仅10%，推理速度大幅提升

## 摘要（原文）

> Unsupervised industrial anomaly detection requires accurately identifying defects without labeled data. Traditional autoencoder-based methods often struggle with incomplete anomaly suppression and loss of fine details, as their single-pass decoding fails to effectively handle anomalies with varying severity and scale. We propose a recursive architecture for autoencoder (RcAE), which performs reconstruction iteratively to progressively suppress anomalies while refining normal structures. Unlike traditional single-pass models, this recursive design naturally produces a sequence of reconstructions, progressively exposing suppressed abnormal patterns. To leverage this reconstruction dynamics, we introduce a Cross Recursion Detection (CRD) module that tracks inconsistencies across recursion steps, enhancing detection of both subtle and large-scale anomalies. Additionally, we incorporate a Detail Preservation Network (DPN) to recover high-frequency textures typically lost during reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing non-diffusion methods, and achieves performance on par with recent diffusion models with only 10% of their parameters and offering substantially faster inference. These results highlight the practicality and efficiency of our approach for real-world applications.
