## 摘要（原文）

> The Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) is a 3D foundation model that infers camera geometry and scene structure in a single feed-forward pass. Trained in a supervised, single-step fashion on large datasets, VGGT raises a key question: does it build upon geometric concepts like traditional multi-view methods, or does it rely primarily on learned appearance-based data-driven priors? In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of VGGT's internal mechanisms to uncover whether geometric understanding emerges within its representations. By probing intermediate features, analyzing attention patterns, and performing interventions, we examine how the model implements its functionality. Our findings reveal that VGGT implicitly performs correspondence matching within its global attention layers and encodes epipolar geometry, despite being trained without explicit geometric constraints. We further investigate VGGT's dependence on its learned data priors. Using spatial input masking and perturbation experiments, we assess its robustness to occlusions, appearance variations, and camera configurations, comparing it with classical multi-stage pipelines. Together, these insights highlight how VGGT internalizes geometric structure while using learned data-driven priors.
