## 3 点简述
- 现有HLS工具依赖固定优化策略，缺乏针对特定设计的语义理解和硬件指标估计能力。
- DAPO从控制流和数据流图提取语义，利用对比学习生成嵌入，结合分析模型指导强化学习代理。
- 在经典HLS设计上评估，平均比Vitis HLS加速2.36倍。

## 摘要（原文）

> High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools are widely adopted in FPGA-based domain-specific accelerator design. However, existing tools rely on fixed optimization strategies inherited from software compilations, limiting their effectiveness. Tailoring optimization strategies to specific designs requires deep semantic understanding, accurate hardware metric estimation, and advanced search algorithms -- capabilities that current approaches lack.
>   We propose DAPO, a design structure-aware pass ordering framework that extracts program semantics from control and data flow graphs, employs contrastive learning to generate rich embeddings, and leverages an analytical model for accurate hardware metric estimation. These components jointly guide a reinforcement learning agent to discover design-specific optimization strategies. Evaluations on classic HLS designs demonstrate that our end-to-end flow delivers a 2.36 speedup over Vitis HLS on average.
