## 摘要（原文）

> As robots become more integrated into society, detecting robot errors is
> essential for effective human-robot interaction (HRI). When a robot fails
> repeatedly, how can it know when to change its behavior? Humans naturally
> respond to robot errors through verbal and nonverbal cues that intensify over
> successive failures-from confusion and subtle speech changes to visible
> frustration and impatience. While prior work shows that human reactions can
> indicate robot failures, few studies examine how these evolving responses
> reveal successive failures. This research uses machine learning to recognize
> stages of robot failure from human reactions. In a study with 26 participants
> interacting with a robot that made repeated conversational errors, behavioral
> features were extracted from video data to train models for individual users.
> The best model achieved 93.5% accuracy for detecting errors and 84.1% for
> classifying successive failures. Modeling the progression of human reactions
> enhances error detection and understanding of repeated interaction breakdowns
> in HRI.
