- 实验或效果：基于51名参与者的用户研究数据，识别了信任观测器的模型参数。

## 摘要（原文）

> Advances in the control of autonomous systems have accompanied an expansion
> in the potential applications for autonomous robotic systems. The success of
> applications involving humans depends on the quality of interaction between the
> autonomous system and the human supervisor, which is particularly affected by
> the degree of trust that the supervisor places in the autonomous system. Absent
> from the literature are models of supervisor trust dynamics that can
> accommodate asymmetric responses to autonomous system performance and the
> intermittent nature of supervisor-autonomous system communication. This paper
> focuses on formulating an estimated model of supervisor trust that incorporates
> both of these features by employing a switched linear system structure with
> event-triggered sampling of the model input and output. Trust response data
> collected in a user study with 51 participants were then used identify
> parameters for a switched linear model-based observer of supervisor trust.
