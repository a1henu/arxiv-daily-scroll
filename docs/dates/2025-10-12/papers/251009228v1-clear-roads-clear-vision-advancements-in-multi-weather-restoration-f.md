## 摘要（原文）

> Adverse weather conditions such as haze, rain, and snow significantly degrade
> the quality of images and videos, posing serious challenges to intelligent
> transportation systems (ITS) that rely on visual input. These degradations
> affect critical applications including autonomous driving, traffic monitoring,
> and surveillance. This survey presents a comprehensive review of image and
> video restoration techniques developed to mitigate weather-induced visual
> impairments. We categorize existing approaches into traditional prior-based
> methods and modern data-driven models, including CNNs, transformers, diffusion
> models, and emerging vision-language models (VLMs). Restoration strategies are
> further classified based on their scope: single-task models,
> multi-task/multi-weather systems, and all-in-one frameworks capable of handling
> diverse degradations. In addition, we discuss day and night time restoration
> challenges, benchmark datasets, and evaluation protocols. The survey concludes
> with an in-depth discussion on limitations in current research and outlines
> future directions such as mixed/compound-degradation restoration, real-time
> deployment, and agentic AI frameworks. This work aims to serve as a valuable
> reference for advancing weather-resilient vision systems in smart
> transportation environments. Lastly, to stay current with rapid advancements in
> this field, we will maintain regular updates of the latest relevant papers and
> their open-source implementations at
