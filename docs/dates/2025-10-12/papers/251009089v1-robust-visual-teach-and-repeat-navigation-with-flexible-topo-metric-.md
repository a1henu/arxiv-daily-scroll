## 摘要（原文）

> Visual Teach-and-Repeat Navigation is a direct solution for mobile robot to
> be deployed in unknown environments. However, robust trajectory repeat
> navigation still remains challenged due to environmental changing and dynamic
> objects. In this paper, we propose a novel visual teach-and-repeat navigation
> system, which consists of a flexible map representation, robust map matching
> and a map-less local navigation module. During the teaching process, the
> recorded keyframes are formulated as a topo-metric graph and each node can be
> further extended to save new observations. Such representation also alleviates
> the requirement of globally consistent mapping. To enhance the place
> recognition performance during repeating process, instead of using
> frame-to-frame matching, we firstly implement keyframe clustering to aggregate
> similar connected keyframes into local map and perform place recognition based
> on visual frame-tolocal map matching strategy. To promote the local goal
> persistent tracking performance, a long-term goal management algorithm is
> constructed, which can avoid the robot getting lost due to environmental
> changes or obstacle occlusion. To achieve the goal without map, a local
> trajectory-control candidate optimization algorithm is proposed. Extensively
> experiments are conducted on our mobile platform. The results demonstrate that
> our system is superior to the baselines in terms of robustness and
> effectiveness.
