**作者**：Yuyang Gao, Haofei Ma, Pai Zheng  

**一句话要点**：提出Glovity系统以解决接触丰富灵巧操作中的反馈不足问题

**关键词**：灵巧操作, 力反馈系统, 触觉手套, 模仿学习, 开源硬件

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：接触丰富任务中缺乏直观力反馈和精确重定向，导致操作成功率低。
- 方法要点：集成空间力反馈设备和带指尖校准的触觉手套，提供丰富反馈。
- 实验效果：力反馈使书本翻转成功率从48%提升至78%，模仿学习在新型任务中表现优异。

## 摘要（原文）

> We present Glovity, a novel, low-cost wearable teleoperation system that
> integrates a spatial wrench (force-torque) feedback device with a haptic glove
> featuring fingertip Hall sensor calibration, enabling feedback-rich dexterous
> manipulation. Glovity addresses key challenges in contact-rich tasks by
> providing intuitive wrench and tactile feedback, while overcoming embodiment
> gaps through precise retargeting. User studies demonstrate significant
> improvements: wrench feedback boosts success rates in book-flipping tasks from
> 48% to 78% and reduces completion time by 25%, while fingertip calibration
> enhances thin-object grasping success significantly compared to commercial
> glove. Furthermore, incorporating wrench signals into imitation learning (via
> DP-R3M) achieves high success rate in novel contact-rich scenarios, such as
> adaptive page flipping and force-aware handovers. All hardware designs,
> software will be open-sourced. Project website: https://glovity.github.io/
