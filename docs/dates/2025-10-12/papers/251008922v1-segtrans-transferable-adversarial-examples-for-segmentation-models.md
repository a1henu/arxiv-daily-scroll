**一句话要点**：提出SegTrans框架以提升分割模型间对抗样本的可迁移性

**关键词**：分割模型, 对抗攻击, 可迁移性, 语义重映射, 扰动优化

## 3 点简述
- 分割模型在对抗攻击中可迁移性差，源于上下文依赖和特征分布差异
- 方法将输入划分为局部区域并重映射语义，生成多样增强样本优化扰动
- 实验在PASCAL VOC和Cityscapes数据集上，显著提高迁移成功率与效率

## 摘要（原文）

> Segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial examples
> in white-box settings, but existing adversarial attack methods often show poor
> transferability across different segmentation models. While some researchers
> have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods
> for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these
> models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models
> result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we
> propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input
> sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to
> generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original
> ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of
> adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing
> methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original
> input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations.
> Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes,
> four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that
> SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without
> introducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current
> state-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in
> transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than
> 100%.
