- 方法要点：通过对抗扰动识别不确定视觉令牌，并在自注意力过程中掩码它们。
- 实验或效果：实验显示该方法显著减少幻觉，并能与其他方法协同工作。

## 摘要（原文）

> Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE)
> with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various
> tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object
> hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input
> image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key
> factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found
> that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic
> uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show
> theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that
> exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations
> indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a
> simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the
> VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for
> identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these
> uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers
> of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating
> hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
> reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other
> prior arts.
