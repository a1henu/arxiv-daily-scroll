**一句话要点**：提出FIPER框架以预测生成式机器人策略的运行时失败

**关键词**：失败预测, 生成式模仿学习, 保形预测, 动作不确定性, 机器人安全

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：生成式模仿学习在未知环境或动作误差下易导致任务失败，需早期预测
- 方法要点：通过OOD检测和动作块熵评估失败指标，并利用保形预测校准阈值
- 实验或效果：在多种仿真和真实环境中，FIPER比现有方法更准确、更早预测失败

## 摘要（原文）

> Imitation learning (IL) with generative models, such as diffusion and flow
> matching, has enabled robots to perform complex, long-horizon tasks. However,
> distribution shifts from unseen environments or compounding action errors can
> still cause unpredictable and unsafe behavior, leading to task failure. Early
> failure prediction during runtime is therefore essential for deploying robots
> in human-centered and safety-critical environments. We propose FIPER, a general
> framework for Failure Prediction at Runtime for generative IL policies that
> does not require failure data. FIPER identifies two key indicators of impending
> failure: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) observations detected via random network
> distillation in the policy's embedding space, and (ii) high uncertainty in
> generated actions measured by a novel action-chunk entropy score. Both failure
> prediction scores are calibrated using a small set of successful rollouts via
> conformal prediction. A failure alarm is triggered when both indicators,
> aggregated over short time windows, exceed their thresholds. We evaluate FIPER
> across five simulation and real-world environments involving diverse failure
> modes. Our results demonstrate that FIPER better distinguishes actual failures
> from benign OOD situations and predicts failures more accurately and earlier
> than existing methods. We thus consider this work an important step towards
> more interpretable and safer generative robot policies. Code, data and videos
> are available at https://tum-lsy.github.io/fiper_website.
