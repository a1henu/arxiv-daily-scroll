## 摘要（原文）

> To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation
> (RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications.
> However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval
> accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by
> decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer
> from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the
> query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In
> this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval -
> HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple
> intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment.
> Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy
> similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching
> computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset
> automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study
> shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also
> reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.
