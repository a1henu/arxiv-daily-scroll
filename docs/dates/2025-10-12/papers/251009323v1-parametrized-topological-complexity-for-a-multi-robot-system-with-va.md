## 摘要（原文）

> We study a generalized motion planning problem involving multiple autonomous
> robots navigating in a $d$-dimensional Euclidean space in the presence of a set
> of obstacles whose positions are unknown a priori. Each robot is required to
> visit sequentially a prescribed set of target states, with the number of
> targets varying between robots. This heterogeneous setting generalizes the
> framework considered in the prior works on sequential parametrized topological
> complexity by Farber and the second author of this article. To determine the
> topological complexity of our problem, we formulate it mathematically by
> constructing an appropriate fibration. Our main contribution is the
> determination of this invariant in the generalized setting, which captures the
> minimal algorithmic instability required for designing collision-free motion
> planning algorithms under parameter-dependent constraints. We provide a
> detailed analysis for both odd and even-dimensional ambient spaces, including
> the essential cohomological computations and explicit constructions of
> corresponding motion planning algorithms.
