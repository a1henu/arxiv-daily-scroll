## 摘要（原文）

> Ensuring robust robotic navigation in dynamic environments is a key
> challenge, as traditional testing methods often struggle to cover the full
> spectrum of operational requirements. This paper presents the industrial
> adoption of Surrealist, a simulation-based test generation framework originally
> for UAVs, now applied to the ANYmal quadrupedal robot for industrial
> inspection. Our method uses a search-based algorithm to automatically generate
> challenging obstacle avoidance scenarios, uncovering failures often missed by
> manual testing. In a pilot phase, generated test suites revealed critical
> weaknesses in one experimental algorithm (40.3% success rate) and served as an
> effective benchmark to prove the superior robustness of another (71.2% success
> rate). The framework was then integrated into the ANYbotics workflow for a
> six-month industrial evaluation, where it was used to test five proprietary
> algorithms. A formal survey confirmed its value, showing it enhances the
> development process, uncovers critical failures, provides objective benchmarks,
> and strengthens the overall verification pipeline.
