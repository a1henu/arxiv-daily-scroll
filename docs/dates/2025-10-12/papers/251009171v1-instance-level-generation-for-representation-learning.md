## 摘要（原文）

> Instance-level recognition (ILR) focuses on identifying individual objects
> rather than broad categories, offering the highest granularity in image
> classification. However, this fine-grained nature makes creating large-scale
> annotated datasets challenging, limiting ILR's real-world applicability across
> domains. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that synthetically
> generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied
> conditions and backgrounds, forming a large-scale training set. Unlike prior
> work on automatic data synthesis, our method is the first to address
> ILR-specific challenges without relying on any real images. Fine-tuning
> foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval
> performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains. Our approach
> offers a new, efficient, and effective alternative to extensive data collection
> and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where the only input is the names
> of the target domains, unlocking a wide range of real-world applications.
