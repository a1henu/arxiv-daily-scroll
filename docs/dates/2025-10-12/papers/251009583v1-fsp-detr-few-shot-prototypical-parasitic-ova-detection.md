## 摘要（原文）

> Object detection in biomedical settings is fundamentally constrained by the
> scarcity of labeled data and the frequent emergence of novel or rare
> categories. We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables
> robust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen
> biomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR
> backbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images
> and learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight
> transformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an
> alignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve
> discriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision.
> Unlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables
> inference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background
> rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining. We also introduce a
> new ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish
> standardized evaluation protocols. Extensive experiments across ova, blood
> cell, and malaria detection tasks demonstrate that FSP-DETR significantly
> outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors, especially in
> low-shot and open-set scenarios.
