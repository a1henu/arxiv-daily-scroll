## 摘要（原文）

> In endovascular surgery, endovascular interventionists push a thin tube
> called a catheter, guided by a thin wire to a treatment site inside the
> patient's blood vessels to treat various conditions such as blood clots,
> aneurysms, and malformations. Guidewires with robotic tips can enhance
> maneuverability, but they present challenges in modeling and control.
> Automation of soft robotic guidewire navigation has the potential to overcome
> these challenges, increasing the precision and safety of endovascular
> navigation. In other surgical domains, end-to-end imitation learning has shown
> promising results. Thus, we develop a transformer-based imitation learning
> framework with goal conditioning, relative action outputs, and automatic
> contrast dye injections to enable generalizable soft robotic guidewire
> navigation in an aneurysm targeting task. We train the model on 36 different
> modular bifurcated geometries, generating 647 total demonstrations under
> simulated fluoroscopy, and evaluate it on three previously unseen vascular
> geometries. The model can autonomously drive the tip of the robot to the
> aneurysm location with a success rate of 83% on the unseen geometries,
> outperforming several baselines. In addition, we present ablation and baseline
> studies to evaluate the effectiveness of each design and data collection
> choice. Project website: https://softrobotnavigation.github.io/
