## 摘要（原文）

> Multi-robot navigation in unknown, structurally constrained, and GPS-denied
> environments presents a fundamental trade-off between global strategic
> foresight and local tactical agility, particularly under limited communication.
> Centralized methods achieve global optimality but suffer from high
> communication overhead, while distributed methods are efficient but lack the
> broader awareness to avoid deadlocks and topological traps. To address this, we
> propose a fully decentralized, hierarchical relative navigation framework that
> achieves both strategic foresight and tactical agility without a unified
> coordinate system. At the strategic layer, robots build and exchange
> lightweight topological maps upon opportunistic encounters. This process
> fosters an emergent global awareness, enabling the planning of efficient,
> trap-avoiding routes at an abstract level. This high-level plan then inspires
> the tactical layer, which operates on local metric information. Here, a
> sampling-based escape point strategy resolves dense spatio-temporal conflicts
> by generating dynamically feasible trajectories in real time, concurrently
> satisfying tight environmental and kinodynamic constraints. Extensive
> simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that our system
> significantly outperforms in success rate and efficiency, especially in
> communication-limited environments with complex topological structures.
