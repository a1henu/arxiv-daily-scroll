**一句话要点**：分析三星图像对角线伪影对PRNU验证的影响并提出解决方案

**关键词**：图像伪影分析, PRNU相机验证, 原始图像处理, 法医图像应用, 智能手机成像

## 3 点简述
- 三星Galaxy S和A系列图像存在对角线伪影，导致PRNU指纹碰撞问题
- 使用PRO模式原始图像可避免伪影，但中端A系列和法医场景无法应用
- 伪影可用于减少HDR误检和定位肖像模式合成虚化区域

## 摘要（原文）

> We investigate diagonal artifacts present in images captured by several
> Samsung smartphones and their impact on PRNU-based camera source verification.
> We first show that certain Galaxy S series models share a common pattern
> causing fingerprint collisions, with a similar issue also found in some Galaxy
> A models. Next, we demonstrate that reliable PRNU verification remains feasible
> for devices supporting PRO mode with raw capture, since raw images bypass the
> processing pipeline that introduces artifacts. This option, however, is not
> available for the mid-range A series models or in forensic cases without access
> to raw images. Finally, we outline potential forensic applications of the
> diagonal artifacts, such as reducing misdetections in HDR images and localizing
> regions affected by synthetic bokeh in portrait-mode images.
