## 摘要（原文）

> Accurate segmentation of 3D medical images is critical for clinical
> applications like disease assessment and treatment planning. While the Segment
> Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has shown remarkable success in video object
> segmentation by leveraging temporal cues, its direct application to 3D medical
> images faces two fundamental domain gaps: 1) the bidirectional anatomical
> continuity between slices contrasts sharply with the unidirectional temporal
> flow in videos, and 2) precise boundary delineation, crucial for morphological
> analysis, is often underexplored in video tasks. To bridge these gaps, we
> propose SAM2-3dMed, an adaptation of SAM2 for 3D medical imaging. Our framework
> introduces two key innovations: 1) a Slice Relative Position Prediction (SRPP)
> module explicitly models bidirectional inter-slice dependencies by guiding SAM2
> to predict the relative positions of different slices in a self-supervised
> manner; 2) a Boundary Detection (BD) module enhances segmentation accuracy
> along critical organ and tissue boundaries. Extensive experiments on three
> diverse medical datasets (the Lung, Spleen, and Pancreas in the Medical
> Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset) demonstrate that SAM2-3dMed significantly
> outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in
> segmentation overlap and boundary precision. Our approach not only advances 3D
> medical image segmentation performance but also offers a general paradigm for
> adapting video-centric foundation models to spatial volumetric data.
