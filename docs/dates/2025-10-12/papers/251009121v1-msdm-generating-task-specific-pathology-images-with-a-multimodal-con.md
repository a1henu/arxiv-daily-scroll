**一句话要点**：提出多模态语义扩散模型以生成病理图像-掩码对，提升细胞和核分割性能

**关键词**：计算病理学, 扩散模型, 图像生成, 细胞分割, 多模态学习, 数据增强

## 3 点简述
- 细胞和核分割面临标注数据稀缺问题，尤其对罕见形态
- 模型融合形态、颜色和元数据，通过多模态条件扩散生成图像-掩码对
- 合成数据显著改善分割模型准确性，如柱状细胞，并验证与真实数据相似性

## 摘要（原文）

> Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies,
> present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in
> computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly,
> synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal
> Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise
> image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the
> generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and
> vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication
> metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These
> heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention,
> enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis
> demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low
> Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under
> matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples,
> exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model
> accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets,
> directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of
> multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and
> generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the
> way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.
