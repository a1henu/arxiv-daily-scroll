## 摘要（原文）

> Accurate segmentation of infant brain MRI is critical for studying early
> neurodevelopment and diagnosing neurological disorders. Yet, it remains a
> fundamental challenge due to continuously evolving anatomy of the subjects,
> motion artifacts, and the scarcity of high-quality labeled data. In this work,
> we present LODi, a novel framework that utilizes prior knowledge from an adult
> brain MRI segmentation model to enhance the segmentation performance of infant
> scans. Given the abundance of publicly available adult brain MRI data, we
> pre-train a segmentation model on a large adult dataset as a starting point.
> Through transfer learning and domain adaptation strategies, we progressively
> adapt the model to the 0-2 year-old population, enabling it to account for the
> anatomical and imaging variability typical of infant scans. The adaptation of
> the adult model is carried out using weakly supervised learning on infant brain
> scans, leveraging silver-standard ground truth labels obtained with FreeSurfer.
> By introducing a novel training strategy that integrates hierarchical feature
> refinement and multi-level consistency constraints, our method enables fast,
> accurate, age-adaptive segmentation, while mitigating scanner and site-specific
> biases. Extensive experiments on both internal and external datasets
> demonstrate the superiority of our approach over traditional supervised
> learning and domain-specific models. Our findings highlight the advantage of
> leveraging adult brain priors as a foundation for age-flexible neuroimaging
> analysis, paving the way for more reliable and generalizable brain MRI
> segmentation across the lifespan.
