**一句话要点**：提出PRNet以解决航拍图像小目标检测中的信息退化问题

**关键词**：小目标检测, 航拍图像, 特征对齐, 实时检测, 渐进细化, 信息保留

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：航拍图像小目标检测中，浅层空间细节与语义信息对齐困难，导致漏检和误检
- 方法要点：通过渐进细化颈部和增强切片采样模块，保留并高效利用原始浅层特征
- 实验或效果：在VisDrone等数据集上，PRNet在计算约束下优于现有方法，实现高精度与效率平衡

## 摘要（原文）

> Small object detection in aerial images suffers from severe information
> degradation during feature extraction due to limited pixel representations,
> where shallow spatial details fail to align effectively with semantic
> information, leading to frequent misses and false positives. Existing FPN-based
> methods attempt to mitigate these losses through post-processing enhancements,
> but the reconstructed details often deviate from the original image
> information, impeding their fusion with semantic content. To address this
> limitation, we propose PRNet, a real-time detection framework that prioritizes
> the preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial
> features to enhance small object representations. PRNet achieves this via two
> modules:the Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment
> through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and the Enhanced SliceSamp
> (ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized
> rearrangement and convolution. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone, AI-TOD,
> and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that PRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods
> under comparable computational constraints, achieving superior
> accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.
