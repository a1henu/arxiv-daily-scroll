## 摘要（原文）

> Multi-modal ground-aerial robots have been extensively studied, with a
> significant challenge lying in the integration of conflicting requirements
> across different modes of operation. The Husky robot family, developed at
> Northeastern University, and specifically the Husky v.2 discussed in this
> study, addresses this challenge by incorporating posture manipulation and
> thrust vectoring into multi-modal locomotion through structure repurposing.
> This quadrupedal robot features leg structures that can be repurposed for
> dynamic legged locomotion and flight. In this paper, we present the hardware
> design of the robot and report primary results on dynamic quadrupedal legged
> locomotion and hovering.
