## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：农业无人机监测中动物数据稀缺，受限于小、遮挡或部分可见动物。
- 方法要点：分割动物并应用变换和扩散合成，生成真实多样场景增强检测。
- 实验或效果：初步实验显示增强数据集在动物检测任务上优于基线模型。

## 摘要（原文）

> Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring
> systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial
> drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces
> limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small,
> occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail
> to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that
> reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds,
> environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a
> problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these
> unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data
> augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in
> constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and
> augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create
> realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring
> performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset
> yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal
> detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers
> real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios,
> bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.
