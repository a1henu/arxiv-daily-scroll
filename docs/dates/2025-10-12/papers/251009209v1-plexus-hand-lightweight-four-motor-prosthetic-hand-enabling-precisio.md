**arXiv**：[2510.09209v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09209) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09209.pdf)  
**作者**：Yuki Kuroda, Tomoya Takahashi, Cristian C Beltran-Hernandez, Masashi Hamaya, Kazutoshi Tanaka  

**一句话要点**：提出四电机轻量假手，结合单轴拇指实现精确-侧向灵巧操作。

**关键词**：假肢手设计, 灵巧操作, 轻量化结构, 电机优化, 实验验证

## 3 点简述
- 现有假手仅静态抓握，多电机或复杂机制导致笨重和易损问题。
- 采用单轴拇指和优化定位，仅四电机实现轻量化和内部电机保护。
- 实验验证重定向任务成功率90-100%，支持盖章和螺丝刀操作。

## 摘要（原文）

> Electric prosthetic hands should be lightweight to decrease the burden on the
> user, shaped like human hands for cosmetic purposes, and have motors inside to
> protect them from damage and dirt. In addition to the ability to perform daily
> activities, these features are essential for everyday use of the hand. In-hand
> manipulation is necessary to perform daily activities such as transitioning
> between different postures, particularly through rotational movements, such as
> reorienting cards before slot insertion and operating tools such as
> screwdrivers. However, currently used electric prosthetic hands only achieve
> static grasp postures, and existing manipulation approaches require either many
> motors, which makes the prosthesis heavy for daily use in the hand, or complex
> mechanisms that demand a large internal space and force external motor
> placement, complicating attachment and exposing the components to damage.
> Alternatively, we combine a single-axis thumb and optimized thumb positioning
> to achieve basic posture and in-hand manipulation, that is, the reorientation
> between precision and lateral grasps, using only four motors in a lightweight
> (311 g) prosthetic hand. Experimental validation using primitive objects of
> various widths (5-30 mm) and shapes (cylinders and prisms) resulted in success
> rates of 90-100% for reorientation tasks. The hand performed seal stamping and
> USB device insertion, as well as rotation to operate a screwdriver.
