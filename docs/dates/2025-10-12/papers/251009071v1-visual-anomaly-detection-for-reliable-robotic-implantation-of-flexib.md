## 摘要（原文）

> Flexible microelectrode (FME) implantation into brain cortex is challenging
> due to the deformable fiber-like structure of FME probe and the interaction
> with critical bio-tissue. To ensure reliability and safety, the implantation
> process should be monitored carefully. This paper develops an image-based
> anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME
> implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to
> check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point,
> respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned
> regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a
> pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we
> propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the
> sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we
> select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the
> raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific
> scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with the image
> datasets collected from our implantation system.
