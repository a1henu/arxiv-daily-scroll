## 摘要（原文）

> In this work, we first revisit the sampling issues in current autoregressive
> (AR) image generation models and identify that image tokens, unlike text
> tokens, exhibit lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution.
> Accordingly, we present an entropy-informed decoding strategy that facilitates
> higher autoregressive generation quality with faster synthesis speed.
> Specifically, the proposed method introduces two main innovations: 1) dynamic
> temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, enhancing
> the balance between content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural
> coherence in both mask-based and scale-wise models, without extra computational
> overhead, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding,
> achieving near-lossless generation at about 85\% of the inference cost of
> conventional acceleration methods. Extensive experiments across multiple
> benchmarks using diverse AR image generation models demonstrate the
> effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing both generation
> quality and sampling speed.
