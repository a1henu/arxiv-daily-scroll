## 摘要（原文）

> The audiovisual industry is undergoing a profound transformation as it is
> integrating AI developments not only to automate routine tasks but also to
> inspire new forms of art. This paper addresses the problem of producing a
> virtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style
> and shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters,
> thus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related
> domains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning
> technique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core
> challenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and
> the few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a
> multi-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual
> characters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based
> parameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization
> set and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our
> approach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned
> style. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it
> to relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation
> study. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse
> characters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference
> characters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and
> highlighting the potential of our method.
