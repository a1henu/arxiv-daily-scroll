## 摘要（原文）

> Soft robots offer significant advantages in safety and adaptability, yet
> achieving precise and dynamic control remains a major challenge due to their
> inherently complex and nonlinear dynamics. Recently, Data-enabled Predictive
> Control (DeePC) has emerged as a promising model-free approach that bypasses
> explicit system identification by directly leveraging input-output data. While
> DeePC has shown success in other domains, its application to soft robots
> remains underexplored, particularly for three-dimensional (3D) soft robotic
> systems. This paper addresses this gap by developing and experimentally
> validating an effective DeePC framework on a 3D, cable-driven soft arm.
> Specifically, we design and fabricate a soft robotic arm with a thick tubing
> backbone for stability, a dense silicone body with large cavities for strength
> and flexibility, and rigid endcaps for secure termination. Using this platform,
> we implement DeePC with singular value decomposition (SVD)-based dimension
> reduction for two key control tasks: fixed-point regulation and trajectory
> tracking in 3D space. Comparative experiments with a baseline model-based
> controller demonstrate DeePC's superior accuracy, robustness, and adaptability,
> highlighting its potential as a practical solution for dynamic control of soft
> robots.
