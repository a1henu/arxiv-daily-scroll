**一句话要点**：提出基于图像的支气管镜拓扑定位方法，用于导航辅助，无需患者CT扫描。

**关键词**：支气管镜导航, 拓扑定位, 图像处理, 医学影像分析, 无监督学习, 泛化能力

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：支气管镜导航中，医生难以在复杂气道中定位，现有方法依赖CT扫描和额外传感器。
- 方法要点：仅使用幻影数据训练，实现图像到通用气道模型的拓扑定位，无需患者特定数据。
- 实验或效果：在真实数据测试序列上表现优于现有方法，具有良好的泛化能力。

## 摘要（原文）

> Video bronchoscopy is a fundamental procedure in respiratory medicine, where
> medical experts navigate through the bronchial tree of a patient to diagnose or
> operate the patient. Surgeons need to determine the position of the scope as
> they go through the airway until they reach the area of interest. This task is
> very challenging for practitioners due to the complex bronchial tree structure
> and varying doctor experience and training. Navigation assistance to locate the
> bronchoscope during the procedure can improve its outcome. Currently used
> techniques for navigational guidance commonly rely on previous CT scans of the
> patient to obtain a 3D model of the airway, followed by tracking of the scope
> with additional sensors or image registration. These methods obtain accurate
> locations but imply additional setup, scans and training. Accurate metric
> localization is not always required, and a topological localization with regard
> to a generic airway model can often suffice to assist the surgeon with
> navigation. We present an image-based bronchoscopy topological localization
> pipeline to provide navigation assistance during the procedure, with no need of
> patient CT scan. Our approach is trained only on phantom data, eliminating the
> high cost of real data labeling, and presents good generalization capabilities.
> The results obtained surpass existing methods, particularly on real data test
> sequences.
