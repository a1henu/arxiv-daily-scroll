## 摘要（原文）

> Change monitoring is an essential task for cranberry farming as it provides
> both breeders and growers with the ability to analyze growth, predict yield,
> and make treatment decisions. However, this task is often done manually,
> requiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep
> learning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of
> hard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for
> fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop
> growth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised
> approach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task
> (time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the
> time-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal
> tracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be
> used to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of
> cranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry
> fruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing
> season (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide
> application, yield, and rot. Our approach is general and can be applied to
> other crops and applications (code and dataset can be found at https://github.
> com/ronan-39/tlt/).
