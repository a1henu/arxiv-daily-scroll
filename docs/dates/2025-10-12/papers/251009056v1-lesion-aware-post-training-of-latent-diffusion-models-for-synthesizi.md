## 摘要（原文）

> Image-to-Image translation models can help mitigate various challenges
> inherent to medical image acquisition. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) leverage
> efficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of
> state-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a
> trade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for
> high-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical
> when generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often
> occupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct
> these regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical
> decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training
> framework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating
> lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it
> not only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of
> lesion delineation. We evaluate our framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation in
> acute ischemic stroke patients, where early and accurate diagnosis is critical
> for optimal treatment selection and improved patient outcomes. While diffusion
> MRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, its clinical utility is often
> constrained by high costs and low accessibility. Using a dataset of 817
> patients, we demonstrate that our framework improves overall image quality and
> enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT
> perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models.
> Furthermore, our post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs
> and exhibits substantial potential for broader applications across diverse
> medical image translation tasks.
