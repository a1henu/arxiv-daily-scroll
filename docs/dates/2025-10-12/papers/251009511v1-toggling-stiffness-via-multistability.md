## 摘要（原文）

> Mechanical metamaterials enable unconventional and programmable mechanical
> responses through structural design rather than material composition. In this
> work, we introduce a multistable mechanical metamaterial that exhibits a
> toggleable stiffness effect, where the effective shear stiffness switches
> discretely between stable configurations. The mechanical analysis of surrogate
> beam models of the unit cell reveal that this behavior originates from the
> rotation transmitted by the support beams to the curved beam, which governs the
> balance between bending and axial deformation. The stiffness ratio between the
> two states of the unit cell can be tuned by varying the slenderness of the
> support beams or by incorporating localized hinges that modulate rotational
> transfer. Experiments on 3D-printed prototypes validate the numerical
> predictions, confirming consistent stiffness toggling across different
> geometries. Finally, we demonstrate a monolithic soft clutch that leverages
> this effect to achieve programmable, stepwise stiffness modulation. This work
> establishes a design strategy for toggleable stiffness using multistable
> metamaterials, paving the way for adaptive, lightweight, and autonomous systems
> in soft robotics and smart structures.
