## 摘要（原文）

> Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis),
> are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high
> incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder
> tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate
> diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for
> low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research
> introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for
> diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application
> of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of
> shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework
> (HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and
> disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition
> to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called
> Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action
> recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the
> effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire
> medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in
> medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons,
> the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by
> 79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical
> contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video
> understanding in the medical field.
