## 摘要（原文）

> The scene perception, understanding, and simulation are fundamental
> techniques for embodied-AI agents, while existing solutions are still prone to
> segmentation deficiency, dynamic objects' interference, sensor data sparsity,
> and view-limitation problems. This paper proposes a novel framework, named
> SPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic
> Segmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into
> an iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive
> attention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via
> enrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically
> adjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy
> is integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation
> results from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the
> confidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the
> camera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the
> learning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is
> beneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to
> synthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive
> experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based
> feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the
> odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.
