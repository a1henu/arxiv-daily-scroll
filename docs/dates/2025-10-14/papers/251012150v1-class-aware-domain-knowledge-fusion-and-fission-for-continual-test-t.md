## 摘要（原文）

> Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to quickly fine-tune the model
> during the test phase so that it can adapt to multiple unknown downstream
> domain distributions without pre-acquiring downstream domain data. To this end,
> existing advanced CTTA methods mainly reduce the catastrophic forgetting of
> historical knowledge caused by irregular switching of downstream domain data by
> restoring the initial model or reusing historical models. However, these
> methods are usually accompanied by serious insufficient learning of new
> knowledge and interference from potentially harmful historical knowledge,
> resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we propose a
> class-aware domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission method for continual test-time
> adaptation, called KFF, which adaptively expands and merges class-aware domain
> knowledge in old and new domains according to the test-time data from different
> domains, where discriminative historical knowledge can be dynamically
> accumulated. Specifically, considering the huge domain gap within streaming
> data, a domain Knowledge FIssion (KFI) module is designed to adaptively
> separate new domain knowledge from a paired class-aware domain prompt pool,
> alleviating the impact of negative knowledge brought by old domains that are
> distinct from the current domain. Besides, to avoid the cumulative computation
> and storage overheads from continuously fissioning new knowledge, a domain
> Knowledge FUsion (KFU) module is further designed to merge the fissioned new
> knowledge into the existing knowledge pool with minimal cost, where a greedy
> knowledge dynamic merging strategy is designed to improve the compatibility of
> new and old knowledge while keeping the computational efficiency. Extensive
> experiments on the ImageNet-C dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed
> method against other methods.
