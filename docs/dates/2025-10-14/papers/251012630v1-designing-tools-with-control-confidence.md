**作者**：Ajith Anil Meera, Abian Torres, Pablo Lanillos  

**一句话要点**：提出控制置信度优化框架以增强机器人工具在环境不确定性下的鲁棒性

**关键词**：自主工具设计, 控制置信度, 鲁棒性优化, 进化算法, 机器人仿真

## 3 点简述
- 当前自主工具设计框架仅优化性能，忽略代理对工具重复使用的置信度问题
- 引入神经启发控制置信度项，结合CMAES进化优化策略设计任务条件化工具
- 仿真显示控制置信度目标函数提升工具鲁棒性，并在控制扰动下平衡准确性与鲁棒性

## 摘要（原文）

> Prehistoric humans invented stone tools for specialized tasks by not just
> maximizing the tool's immediate goal-completion accuracy, but also increasing
> their confidence in the tool for later use under similar settings. This factor
> contributed to the increased robustness of the tool, i.e., the least
> performance deviations under environmental uncertainties. However, the current
> autonomous tool design frameworks solely rely on performance optimization,
> without considering the agent's confidence in tool use for repeated use. Here,
> we take a step towards filling this gap by i) defining an optimization
> framework for task-conditioned autonomous hand tool design for robots, where
> ii) we introduce a neuro-inspired control confidence term into the optimization
> routine that helps the agent to design tools with higher robustness. Through
> rigorous simulations using a robotic arm, we show that tools designed with
> control confidence as the objective function are more robust to environmental
> uncertainties during tool use than a pure accuracy-driven objective. We further
> show that adding control confidence to the objective function for tool design
> provides a balance between the robustness and goal accuracy of the designed
> tools under control perturbations. Finally, we show that our CMAES-based
> evolutionary optimization strategy for autonomous tool design outperforms other
> state-of-the-art optimizers by designing the optimal tool within the fewest
> iterations. Code: https://github.com/ajitham123/Tool_design_control_confidence.
