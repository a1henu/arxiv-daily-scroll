## 摘要（原文）

> The use of robots in industrial settings continues to grow, driven by the
> need to address complex societal challenges such as labor shortages, aging
> populations, and ever-increasing production demands. In this abstract, we
> advocate for (and demonstrate) a transdisciplinary approach when considering
> robotics in the workplace. Transdisciplinarity emphasizes the integration of
> academic research with pragmatic expertise and embodied experiential knowledge,
> that prioritize values such as worker wellbeing and job attractiveness. In the
> following, we describe an ongoing multi-pronged effort to explore the potential
> of collaborative robots in the context of airplane engine repair and
> maintenance operations.
