**一句话要点**：提出场景坐标重建先验以提升SCR模型在训练图像不足时的性能

**关键词**：场景坐标回归, 重建先验, 点云扩散模型, 视觉重定位, 室内场景, 多视角约束

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：SCR模型在训练图像多视角约束不足时退化，导致场景表示不准确
- 方法要点：引入概率重解释，融合深度分布和点云扩散先验，优化预测场景点
- 实验或效果：在室内数据集上提升点云一致性、注册率和相机位姿，改善下游任务

## 摘要（原文）

> Scene coordinate regression (SCR) models have proven to be powerful implicit
> scene representations for 3D vision, enabling visual relocalization and
> structure-from-motion. SCR models are trained specifically for one scene. If
> training images imply insufficient multi-view constraints SCR models
> degenerate. We present a probabilistic reinterpretation of training SCR models,
> which allows us to infuse high-level reconstruction priors. We investigate
> multiple such priors, ranging from simple priors over the distribution of
> reconstructed depth values to learned priors over plausible scene coordinate
> configurations. For the latter, we train a 3D point cloud diffusion model on a
> large corpus of indoor scans. Our priors push predicted 3D scene points towards
> plausible geometry at each training step to increase their likelihood. On three
> indoor datasets our priors help learning better scene representations,
> resulting in more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates and
> better camera poses, with a positive effect on down-stream tasks such as novel
> view synthesis and camera relocalization.
