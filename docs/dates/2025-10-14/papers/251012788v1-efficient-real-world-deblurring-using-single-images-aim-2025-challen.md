**一句话要点**：报告AIM 2025高效真实世界单图像去模糊挑战，评估方法在效率约束下的性能

**关键词**：图像去模糊, 效率约束, 真实世界图像, PSNR评估, 挑战报告

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：在真实世界图像中高效去模糊，需满足参数少于500万和计算量低于200 GMACs
- 方法要点：基于RSBlur数据集，使用双相机系统捕获模糊与退化图像对进行方法开发
- 实验或效果：最佳方法PSNR达31.1298 dB，4个团队提交有效方案，展示高效去模糊潜力

## 摘要（原文）

> This paper reviews the AIM 2025 Efficient Real-World Deblurring using Single
> Images Challenge, which aims to advance in efficient real-blur restoration. The
> challenge is based on a new test set based on the well known RSBlur dataset.
> Pairs of blur and degraded images in this dataset are captured using a
> double-camera system. Participant were tasked with developing solutions to
> effectively deblur these type of images while fulfilling strict efficiency
> constraints: fewer than 5 million model parameters and a computational budget
> under 200 GMACs. A total of 71 participants registered, with 4 teams finally
> submitting valid solutions. The top-performing approach achieved a PSNR of
> 31.1298 dB, showcasing the potential of efficient methods in this domain. This
> paper provides a comprehensive overview of the challenge, compares the proposed
> solutions, and serves as a valuable reference for researchers in efficient
> real-world image deblurring.
