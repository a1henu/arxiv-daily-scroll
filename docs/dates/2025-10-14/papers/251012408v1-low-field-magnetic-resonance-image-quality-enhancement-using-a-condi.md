## 摘要（原文）

> This paper introduces a novel framework for image quality transfer based on
> conditional flow matching (CFM). Unlike conventional generative models that
> rely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives, CFM learns a continuous
> flow between a noise distribution and target data distributions through the
> direct regression of an optimal velocity field. We evaluate this approach in
> the context of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), a rapidly
> emerging modality that offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from
> inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality. Our
> framework is designed to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from their
> corresponding low-field inputs, thereby bridging the quality gap without
> requiring expensive infrastructure. Experiments demonstrate that CFM not only
> achieves state-of-the-art performance, but also generalizes robustly to both
> in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Importantly, it does so while
> utilizing significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods.
> These results underline the potential of CFM as a powerful and scalable tool
> for MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments.
