## 摘要（原文）

> Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) provide a flexible representation for 3D
> shapes with arbitrary topology, including open and closed surfaces, orientable
> and non-orientable geometries, and non-manifold structures. While recent neural
> approaches have shown promise in learning UDFs, they often suffer from
> numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability. We
> present a lightweight, network-free method, Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion (VAD),
> for computing UDFs directly from unoriented point clouds. Our approach begins
> by assigning bi-directional normals to input points, guided by two
> Voronoi-based geometric criteria encoded in an energy function for optimal
> alignment. The aligned normals are then diffused to form an approximate UDF
> gradient field, which is subsequently integrated to recover the final UDF.
> Experiments demonstrate that VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces,
> as well as complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries, while remaining
> computationally efficient and stable.
