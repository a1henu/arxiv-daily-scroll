## 摘要（原文）

> Evaluating the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires diverse,
> safety-critical scenarios, with collisions being especially important yet rare
> and unsafe to collect in the real world. Therefore, the community has been
> focusing on generating safety-critical scenarios in simulation. However,
> controlling attributes such as collision type and time-to-accident (TTA)
> remains challenging. We introduce a new task called controllable collision
> scenario generation, where the goal is to produce trajectories that realize a
> user-specified collision type and TTA, to investigate the feasibility of
> automatically generating desired collision scenarios. To support this task, we
> present COLLIDE, a large-scale collision scenario dataset constructed by
> transforming real-world driving logs into diverse collisions, balanced across
> five representative collision types and different TTA intervals. We propose a
> framework that predicts Collision Pattern, a compact and interpretable
> representation that captures the spatial configuration of the ego and the
> adversarial vehicles at impact, before rolling out full adversarial
> trajectories. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong baselines
> in both collision rate and controllability. Furthermore, generated scenarios
> consistently induce higher planner failure rates, revealing limitations of
> existing planners. We demonstrate that these scenarios fine-tune planners for
> robustness improvements, contributing to safer AV deployment in different
> collision scenarios.
