## 摘要（原文）

> Pruning is an essential agricultural practice for orchards. Proper pruning
> can promote healthier growth and optimize fruit production throughout the
> orchard's lifespan. Robot manipulators have been developed as an automated
> solution for this repetitive task, which typically requires seasonal labor with
> specialized skills. While previous research has primarily focused on the
> challenges of perception, the complexities of manipulation are often
> overlooked. These challenges involve planning and control in both joint and
> Cartesian spaces to guide the end-effector through intricate, obstructive
> branches. Our work addresses the behavior planning challenge for a robotic
> pruning system, which entails a multi-level planning problem in environments
> with complex collisions. In this paper, we formulate the planning problem for a
> high-dimensional robotic arm in a pruning scenario, investigate the system's
> intrinsic redundancies, and propose a comprehensive pruning workflow that
> integrates perception, modeling, and holistic planning. In our experiments, we
> demonstrate that more comprehensive planning methods can significantly enhance
> the performance of the robotic manipulator. Finally, we implement the proposed
> workflow on a real-world robot. As a result, this work complements previous
> efforts on robotic pruning and motivates future research and development in
> planning for pruning applications.
