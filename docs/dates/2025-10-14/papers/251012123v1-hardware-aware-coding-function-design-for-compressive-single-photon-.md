## 摘要（原文）

> Single-photon cameras are becoming increasingly popular in time-of-flight 3D
> imaging because they can time-tag individual photons with extreme resolution.
> However, their performance is susceptible to hardware limitations, such as
> system bandwidth, maximum laser power, sensor data rates, and in-sensor memory
> and compute resources. Compressive histograms were recently introduced as a
> solution to the challenge of data rates through an online in-sensor compression
> of photon timestamp data. Although compressive histograms work within limited
> in-sensor memory and computational resources, they underperform when subjected
> to real-world illumination hardware constraints. To address this, we present a
> constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions for
> compressive single-photon 3D imaging. Using gradient descent, we jointly
> optimize an illumination and coding matrix (i.e., the coding functions) that
> adheres to hardware constraints. We show through extensive simulations that our
> coding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both
> bandwidth and peak power constraints. This advantage is particularly pronounced
> in systems constrained by peak power. Finally, we show that our approach adapts
> to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses by evaluating it on a real-world
> system with a non-ideal impulse response function.
