## 摘要（原文）

> Recent advances in end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving have been enabled by
> training on diverse large-scale driving datasets, yet autonomous driving models
> still struggle in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. The COOOL benchmark
> targets this gap by encouraging hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies,
> and the 2COOOL challenge extends it to generating human-interpretable incident
> reports. We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report
> generation from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident
> frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models
> (VLMs). We further improve factual accuracy and readability through model
> ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol. On the official 2COOOL
> open leaderboard, our method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best
> CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives. These
> results indicate that hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction
> for accident analysis and for broader understanding of safety-critical traffic
> events. The implementation and code are available at
> https://github.com/riron1206/kaggle-2COOOL-2nd-Place-Solution.
