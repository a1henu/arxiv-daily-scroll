## 摘要（原文）

> In the evolving landscape of high-speed agile quadrotor flight, achieving
> precise trajectory tracking at the platform's operational limits is paramount.
> Controllers must handle actuator constraints, exhibit robustness to
> disturbances, and remain computationally efficient for safety-critical
> applications. In this work, we present a novel neural-augmented feedback
> controller for agile flight control. The controller addresses individual
> limitations of existing state-of-the-art control paradigms and unifies their
> strengths. We demonstrate the controller's capabilities, including the accurate
> tracking of highly aggressive trajectories that surpass the feasibility of the
> actuators. Notably, the controller provides universal stability guarantees,
> enhancing its robustness and tracking performance even in exceedingly
> disturbance-prone settings. Its nonlinear feedback structure is highly
> efficient enabling fast computation at high update rates. Moreover, the
> learning process in simulation is both fast and stable, and the controller's
> inherent robustness allows direct deployment to real-world platforms without
> the need for training augmentations or fine-tuning.
