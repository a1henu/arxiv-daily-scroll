**关键词**：人脸修复, 扩散模型, 自监督学习, 选择性引导, 老照片处理, 图像增强

## 3 点简述
- 老照片人脸修复面临破损、褪色和严重模糊等复合退化挑战
- 利用弱引导生成伪参考人脸，通过结构引导和颜色精炼实现区域选择性修复
- 在自建基准上，SSDiff在感知质量、保真度和区域可控性方面优于现有方法

## 摘要（原文）

> Old-photo face restoration poses significant challenges due to compounded
> degradations such as breakage, fading, and severe blur. Existing pre-trained
> diffusion-guided methods either rely on explicit degradation priors or global
> statistical guidance, which struggle with localized artifacts or face color. We
> propose Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion (SSDiff), which leverages
> pseudo-reference faces generated by a pre-trained diffusion model under weak
> guidance. These pseudo-labels exhibit structurally aligned contours and natural
> colors, enabling region-specific restoration via staged supervision: structural
> guidance applied throughout the denoising process and color refinement in later
> steps, aligned with the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion. By incorporating
> face parsing maps and scratch masks, our method selectively restores breakage
> regions while avoiding identity mismatch. We further construct VintageFace, a
> 300-image benchmark of real old face photos with varying degradation levels.
> SSDiff outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual
> quality, fidelity, and regional controllability. Code link:
