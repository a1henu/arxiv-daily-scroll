## 摘要（原文）

> Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial when deploying deep neural
> networks in the real world to ensure the reliability and safety of their
> applications. One main challenge in OOD detection is that neural network models
> often produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. While some methods using
> auxiliary OOD datasets or generating fake OOD images have shown promising OOD
> detection performance, they are limited by the high costs of data collection
> and training. In this study, we propose a novel and effective OOD detection
> method that utilizes local background features as fake OOD features for model
> training. Inspired by the observation that OOD images generally share similar
> background regions with ID images, the background features are extracted from
> ID images as simulated OOD visual representations during training based on the
> local invariance of convolution. Through being optimized to reduce the
> $L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks are able to
> alleviate the overconfidence issue on OOD data. Extensive experiments on
> multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our
> method and its wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods,
> with new state-of-the-art performance achieved from our method.
