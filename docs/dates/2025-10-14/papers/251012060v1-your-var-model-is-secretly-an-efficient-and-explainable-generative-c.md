## 摘要（原文）

> Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for
> classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as
> robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has
> been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational
> cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based
> methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In
> this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in
> visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for
> studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we
> introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a
> superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly
> improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method
> exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In
> particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables
> visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates
> inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning
> tasks.
