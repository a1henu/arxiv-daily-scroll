## 摘要（原文）

> Zero-shot denoisers address the dataset dependency of deep-learning-based
> denoisers, enabling the denoising of unseen single images. Nonetheless,
> existing zero-shot methods suffer from long training times and rely on the
> assumption of noise independence and a zero-mean property, limiting their
> effectiveness in real-world denoising scenarios where noise characteristics are
> more complicated. This paper proposes an efficient and effective method for
> real-world denoising, the Zero-Shot denoiser based on Cross-Frequency
> Consistency (ZSCFC), which enables training and denoising with a single noisy
> image and does not rely on assumptions about noise distribution. Specifically,
> image textures exhibit position similarity and content consistency across
> different frequency bands, while noise does not. Based on this property, we
> developed cross-frequency consistency loss and an ultralight network to realize
> image denoising. Experiments on various real-world image datasets demonstrate
> that our ZSCFC outperforms other state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in terms of
> computational efficiency and denoising performance.
