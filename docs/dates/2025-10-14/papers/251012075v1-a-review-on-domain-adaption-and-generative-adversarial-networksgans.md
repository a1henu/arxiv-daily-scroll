# A Review on Domain Adaption and Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs)
**arXiv**：[2510.12075v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12075) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12075.pdf)  
**作者**：Aashish Dhawan, Divyanshu Mudgal  

**一句话要点**：综述领域自适应与GAN方法以解决计算机视觉中标注数据稀缺问题

**关键词**：领域自适应, 生成对抗网络, 图像分类, 数据稀缺, 模型迁移

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：计算机视觉中高质量标注数据稀缺，导致模型泛化能力受限
- 方法要点：利用源域训练模型迁移至目标域，如从绘画预测真实图像
- 实验或效果：未知具体实验，但旨在实现与基准结果可比性能

## 摘要（原文）

> The major challenge in today's computer vision scenario is the availability
> of good quality labeled data. In a field of study like image classification,
> where data is of utmost importance, we need to find more reliable methods which
> can overcome the scarcity of data to produce results comparable to previous
> benchmark results. In most cases, obtaining labeled data is very difficult
> because of the high cost of human labor and in some cases impossible. The
> purpose of this paper is to discuss Domain Adaptation and various methods to
> implement it. The main idea is to use a model trained on a particular dataset
> to predict on data from a different domain of the same kind, for example - a
> model trained on paintings of airplanes predicting on real images of airplanes
