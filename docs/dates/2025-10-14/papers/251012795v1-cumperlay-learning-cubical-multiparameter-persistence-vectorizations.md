## 摘要（原文）

> We present CuMPerLay, a novel differentiable vectorization layer that enables
> the integration of Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) into deep learning
> pipelines. While CMP presents a natural and powerful way to topologically work
> with images, its use is hindered by the complexity of multifiltration
> structures as well as the vectorization of CMP. In face of these challenges, we
> introduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes.
> Our CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable
> single-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly
> learned. Thanks to the differentiability, its robust topological feature
> vectors can be seamlessly used within state-of-the-art architectures such as
> Swin Transformers. We establish theoretical guarantees for the stability of our
> vectorization under generalized Wasserstein metrics. Our experiments on
> benchmark medical imaging and computer vision datasets show the benefit
> CuMPerLay on classification and segmentation performance, particularly in
> limited-data scenarios. Overall, CuMPerLay offers a promising direction for
> integrating global structural information into deep networks for structured
> image analysis.
