## 摘要（原文）

> Synthesizing realistic cooked food images from raw inputs on edge devices is a challenging generative task, requiring models to capture complex changes in texture, color and structure during cooking. Existing image-to-image generation methods often produce unrealistic results or are too resource-intensive for edge deployment. We introduce the first oven-based cooking-progression dataset with chef-annotated doneness levels and propose an edge-efficient recipe and cooking state guided generator that synthesizes realistic food images conditioned on raw food image. This formulation enables user-preferred visual targets rather than fixed presets. To ensure temporal consistency and culinary plausibility, we introduce a domain-specific \textit{Culinary Image Similarity (CIS)} metric, which serves both as a training loss and a progress-monitoring signal. Our model outperforms existing baselines with significant reductions in FID scores (30\% improvement on our dataset; 60\% on public datasets)
