## 摘要（原文）

> With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, UAVs have become crucial
> for measurement and tracking in patrol systems. However, in GNSS-denied areas,
> satellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents
> a cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object
> detection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view,
> heterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual
> localization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are
> extracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is
> estimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because
> publicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches
> recast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these
> datasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain
> differences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations,
> or generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment,
> content loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object
> detection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite
> images, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and
> intra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based
> node-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization
> performance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that
> our approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and
> generalizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps,
> such as infrared-visible image matching. Our dataset will be publicly available
> at the following URL: https://github.com/liutao23/ODGNNLoc.git.
