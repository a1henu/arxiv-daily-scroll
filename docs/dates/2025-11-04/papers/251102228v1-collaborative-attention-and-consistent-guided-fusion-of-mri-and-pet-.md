## 摘要（原文）

> Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, and its
> early diagnosis is essential for slowing disease progression. Recent studies on
> multimodal neuroimaging fusion using MRI and PET have achieved promising
> results by integrating multi-scale complementary features. However, most
> existing approaches primarily emphasize cross-modal complementarity while
> overlooking the diagnostic importance of modality-specific features. In
> addition, the inherent distributional differences between modalities often lead
> to biased and noisy representations, degrading classification performance. To
> address these challenges, we propose a Collaborative Attention and
> Consistent-Guided Fusion framework for MRI and PET based AD diagnosis. The
> proposed model introduces a learnable parameter representation (LPR) block to
> compensate for missing modality information, followed by a shared encoder and
> modality-independent encoders to preserve both shared and specific
> representations. Furthermore, a consistency-guided mechanism is employed to
> explicitly align the latent distributions across modalities. Experimental
> results on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior
> diagnostic performance compared with existing fusion strategies.
