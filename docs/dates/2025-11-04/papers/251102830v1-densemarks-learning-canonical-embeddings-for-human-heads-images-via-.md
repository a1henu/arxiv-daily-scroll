- 方法要点：使用Vision Transformer预测像素级3D嵌入，通过对比损失和多任务学习训练。
- 实验或效果：在几何感知点匹配和单目头部跟踪中达到先进水平，代码将公开。

## 摘要（原文）

> We propose DenseMarks - a new learned representation for human heads,
> enabling high-quality dense correspondences of human head images. For a 2D
> image of a human head, a Vision Transformer network predicts a 3D embedding for
> each pixel, which corresponds to a location in a 3D canonical unit cube. In
> order to train our network, we collect a dataset of pairwise point matches,
> estimated by a state-of-the-art point tracker over a collection of diverse
> in-the-wild talking heads videos, and guide the mapping via a contrastive loss,
> encouraging matched points to have close embeddings. We further employ
> multi-task learning with face landmarks and segmentation constraints, as well
> as imposing spatial continuity of embeddings through latent cube features,
> which results in an interpretable and queryable canonical space. The
> representation can be used for finding common semantic parts, face/head
> tracking, and stereo reconstruction. Due to the strong supervision, our method
> is robust to pose variations and covers the entire head, including hair.
> Additionally, the canonical space bottleneck makes sure the obtained
> representations are consistent across diverse poses and individuals. We
> demonstrate state-of-the-art results in geometry-aware point matching and
> monocular head tracking with 3D Morphable Models. The code and the model
> checkpoint will be made available to the public.
