## 摘要（原文）

> Satellite image inpainting is a crucial task in remote sensing, where
> accurately restoring missing or occluded regions is essential for robust image
> analysis. In this paper, we propose KAO, a novel framework that utilizes
> Kernel-Adaptive Optimization within diffusion models for satellite image
> inpainting. KAO is specifically designed to address the challenges posed by
> very high-resolution (VHR) satellite datasets, such as DeepGlobe and the
> Massachusetts Roads Dataset. Unlike existing methods that rely on
> preconditioned models requiring extensive retraining or postconditioned models
> with significant computational overhead, KAO introduces a Latent Space
> Conditioning approach, optimizing a compact latent space to achieve efficient
> and accurate inpainting. Furthermore, we incorporate Explicit Propagation into
> the diffusion process, facilitating forward-backward fusion, which improves the
> stability and precision of the method. Experimental results demonstrate that
> KAO sets a new benchmark for VHR satellite image restoration, providing a
> scalable, high-performance solution that balances the efficiency of
> preconditioned models with the flexibility of postconditioned models.
