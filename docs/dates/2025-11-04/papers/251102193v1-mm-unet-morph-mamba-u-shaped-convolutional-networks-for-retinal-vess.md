## 摘要（原文）

> Accurate detection of retinal vessels plays a critical role in reflecting a
> wide range of health status indicators in the clinical diagnosis of ocular
> diseases. Recently, advances in deep learning have led to a surge in retinal
> vessel segmentation methods, which have significantly contributed to the
> quantitative analysis of vascular morphology. However, retinal vasculature
> differs significantly from conventional segmentation targets in that it
> consists of extremely thin and branching structures, whose global morphology
> varies greatly across images. These characteristics continue to pose challenges
> to segmentation precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose
> MM-UNet, a novel architecture tailored for efficient retinal vessel
> segmentation. The model incorporates Morph Mamba Convolution layers, which
> replace pointwise convolutions to enhance branching topological perception
> through morph, state-aware feature sampling. Additionally, Reverse Selective
> State Guidance modules integrate reverse guidance theory with state-space
> modeling to improve geometric boundary awareness and decoding efficiency.
> Extensive experiments conducted on two public retinal vessel segmentation
> datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in
> segmentation accuracy. Compared to the existing approaches, MM-UNet achieves
> F1-score gains of 1.64 $\%$ on DRIVE and 1.25 $\%$ on STARE, demonstrating its
> effectiveness and advancement. The project code is public via
