## 摘要（原文）

> The automation of workflows in advanced microscopy is a key goal where
> foundation models like Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
> show great potential. However, adapting these general-purpose models for
> specialized scientific tasks is critical, and the optimal domain adaptation
> strategy is often unclear. To address this, we introduce PtychoBench, a new
> multi-modal, multi-task benchmark for ptychographic analysis. Using this
> benchmark, we systematically compare two specialization strategies: Supervised
> Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL). We evaluate these strategies
> on a visual artifact detection task with VLMs and a textual parameter
> recommendation task with LLMs in a data-scarce regime. Our findings reveal that
> the optimal specialization pathway is task-dependent. For the visual task, SFT
> and ICL are highly complementary, with a fine-tuned model guided by
> context-aware examples achieving the highest mean performance (Micro-F1 of
> 0.728). Conversely, for the textual task, ICL on a large base model is the
> superior strategy, reaching a peak Micro-F1 of 0.847 and outperforming a
> powerful "super-expert" SFT model (0-shot Micro-F1 of 0.839). We also confirm
> the superiority of context-aware prompting and identify a consistent contextual
> interference phenomenon in fine-tuned models. These results, benchmarked
> against strong baselines including GPT-4o and a DINOv3-based classifier, offer
> key observations for AI in science: the optimal specialization path in our
> benchmark is dependent on the task modality, offering a clear framework for
> developing more effective science-based agentic systems.
