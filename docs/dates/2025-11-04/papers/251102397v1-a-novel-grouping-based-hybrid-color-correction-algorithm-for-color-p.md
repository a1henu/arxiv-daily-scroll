## 摘要（原文）

> Color consistency correction for color point clouds is a fundamental yet
> important task in 3D rendering and compression applications. In the past, most
> previous color correction methods aimed at correcting color for color images.
> The purpose of this paper is to propose a grouping-based hybrid color
> correction algorithm for color point clouds. Our algorithm begins by estimating
> the overlapping rate between the aligned source and target point clouds, and
> then adaptively partitions the target points into two groups, namely the close
> proximity group Gcl and the moderate proximity group Gmod, or three groups,
> namely Gcl, Gmod, and the distant proximity group Gdist, when the estimated
> overlapping rate is low or high, respectively. To correct color for target
> points in Gcl, a K-nearest neighbors based bilateral interpolation (KBI) method
> is proposed. To correct color for target points in Gmod, a joint KBI and the
> histogram equalization (JKHE) method is proposed. For target points in Gdist, a
> histogram equalization (HE) method is proposed for color correction. Finally,
> we discuss the grouping-effect free property and the ablation study in our
> algorithm. The desired color consistency correction benefit of our algorithm
> has been justified through 1086 testing color point cloud pairs against the
> state-of-the-art methods. The C++ source code of our algorithm can be accessed
> from the website: https://github.com/ivpml84079/Point-cloud-color-correction.
