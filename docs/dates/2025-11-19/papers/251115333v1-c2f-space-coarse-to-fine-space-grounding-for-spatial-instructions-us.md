**一句话要点**：提出C2F-Space框架以解决空间指令中复杂推理与细粒度定位问题

**关键词**：空间定位, 视觉语言模型, 粗到细框架, 超像素化, 机器人任务

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：传统方法难以处理空间指令中的距离、几何和物体关系推理
- 方法要点：采用粗到细策略，先估计粗略区域再通过超像素化进行局部细化
- 实验或效果：在新建基准上显著优于五种基线，并验证了模块有效性

## 摘要（原文）

> Space grounding refers to localizing a set of spatial references described in natural language instructions. Traditional methods often fail to account for complex reasoning -- such as distance, geometry, and inter-object relationships -- while vision-language models (VLMs), despite strong reasoning abilities, struggle to produce a fine-grained region of outputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose C2F-Space, a novel coarse-to-fine space-grounding framework that (i) estimates an approximated yet spatially consistent region using a VLM, then (ii) refines the region to align with the local environment through superpixelization. For the coarse estimation, we design a grid-based visual-grounding prompt with a propose-validate strategy, maximizing VLM's spatial understanding and yielding physically and semantically valid canonical region (i.e., ellipses). For the refinement, we locally adapt the region to surrounding environment without over-relaxed to free space. We construct a new space-grounding benchmark and compare C2F-Space with five state-of-the-art baselines using success rate and intersection-over-union. Our C2F-Space significantly outperforms all baselines. Our ablation study confirms the effectiveness of each module in the two-step process and their synergistic effect of the combined framework. We finally demonstrate the applicability of C2F-Space to simulated robotic pick-and-place tasks.
