## 摘要（原文）

> U-Net and other U-shaped architectures have achieved significant success in image deconvolution tasks. However, challenges have emerged, as these methods might generate unrealistic artifacts or hallucinations, which can interfere with analysis in safety-critical scenarios. This paper introduces a novel approach for quantifying and comprehending hallucination artifacts to ensure trustworthy computer vision models. Our method, termed the Conformal Hallucination Estimation Metric (CHEM), is applicable to any image reconstruction model, enabling efficient identification and quantification of hallucination artifacts. It offers two key advantages: it leverages wavelet and shearlet representations to efficiently extract hallucinations of image features and uses conformalized quantile regression to assess hallucination levels in a distribution-free manner. Furthermore, from an approximation theoretical perspective, we explore the reasons why U-shaped networks are prone to hallucinations. We test the proposed approach on the CANDELS astronomical image dataset with models such as U-Net, SwinUNet, and Learnlets, and provide new perspectives on hallucination from different aspects in deep learning-based image processing.
