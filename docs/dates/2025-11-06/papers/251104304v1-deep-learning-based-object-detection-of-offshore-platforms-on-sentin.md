## 摘要（原文）

> The recent and ongoing expansion of marine infrastructure, including offshore
> wind farms, oil and gas platforms, artificial islands, and aquaculture
> facilities, highlights the need for effective monitoring systems. The
> development of robust models for offshore infrastructure detection relies on
> comprehensive, balanced datasets, but falls short when samples are scarce,
> particularly for underrepresented object classes, shapes, and sizes. By
> training deep learning-based YOLOv10 object detection models with a combination
> of synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery acquired in the fourth
> quarter of 2023 from four regions (Caspian Sea, South China Sea, Gulf of
> Guinea, and Coast of Brazil), this study investigates the use of synthetic
> training data to enhance model performance. We evaluated this approach by
> applying the model to detect offshore platforms in three unseen regions (Gulf
> of Mexico, North Sea, Persian Gulf) and thereby assess geographic
> transferability. This region-holdout evaluation demonstrated that the model
> generalises beyond the training areas. In total, 3,529 offshore platforms were
> detected, including 411 in the North Sea, 1,519 in the Gulf of Mexico, and
> 1,593 in the Persian Gulf. The model achieved an F1 score of 0.85, which
> improved to 0.90 upon incorporating synthetic data. We analysed how synthetic
> data enhances the representation of unbalanced classes and overall model
> performance, taking a first step toward globally transferable detection of
> offshore infrastructure. This study underscores the importance of balanced
> datasets and highlights synthetic data generation as an effective strategy to
> address common challenges in remote sensing, demonstrating the potential of
> deep learning for scalable, global offshore infrastructure monitoring.
