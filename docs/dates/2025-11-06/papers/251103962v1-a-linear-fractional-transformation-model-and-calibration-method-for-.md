## 摘要（原文）

> Accurate calibration of internal parameters is a crucial yet challenging
> prerequisite for 3D reconstruction using light field cameras. In this paper, we
> propose a linear fractional transformation(LFT) parameter $\alpha$ to decoupled
> the main lens and micro lens array (MLA). The proposed method includes an
> analytical solution based on least squares, followed by nonlinear refinement.
> The method for detecting features from the raw images is also introduced.
> Experimental results on both physical and simulated data have verified the
> performance of proposed method. Based on proposed model, the simulation of raw
> light field images becomes faster, which is crucial for data-driven deep
> learning methods. The corresponding code can be obtained from the author's
> website.
