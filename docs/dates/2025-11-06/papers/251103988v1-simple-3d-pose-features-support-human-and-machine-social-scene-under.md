## 摘要（原文）

> Humans can quickly and effortlessly extract a variety of information about
> others' social interactions from visual input, ranging from visuospatial cues
> like whether two people are facing each other to higher-level information. Yet,
> the computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and
> social interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI
> vision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose
> information to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI
> vision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth
> estimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video
> clips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict
> human social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly,
> 3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that
> key social information is available in explicit body position but not in the
> learned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise
> embeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the
> critical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a
> compact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and
> direction of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors
> matched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly
> improved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with
> their embeddings. Moreover, the degree to which 3D social pose features were
> represented in each off-the-shelf AI vision model predicted the model's ability
> to match human social judgments. Together, our findings provide strong evidence
> that human social scene understanding relies on explicit representations of 3D
> pose and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives.
