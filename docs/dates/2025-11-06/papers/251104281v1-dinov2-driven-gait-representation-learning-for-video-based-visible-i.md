## 摘要（原文）

> Video-based Visible-Infrared person re-identification (VVI-ReID) aims to
> retrieve the same pedestrian across visible and infrared modalities from video
> sequences. Existing methods tend to exploit modality-invariant visual features
> but largely overlook gait features, which are not only modality-invariant but
> also rich in temporal dynamics, thus limiting their ability to model the
> spatiotemporal consistency essential for cross-modal video matching. To address
> these challenges, we propose a DINOv2-Driven Gait Representation Learning
> (DinoGRL) framework that leverages the rich visual priors of DINOv2 to learn
> gait features complementary to appearance cues, facilitating robust
> sequence-level representations for cross-modal retrieval. Specifically, we
> introduce a Semantic-Aware Silhouette and Gait Learning (SASGL) model, which
> generates and enhances silhouette representations with general-purpose semantic
> priors from DINOv2 and jointly optimizes them with the ReID objective to
> achieve semantically enriched and task-adaptive gait feature learning.
> Furthermore, we develop a Progressive Bidirectional Multi-Granularity
> Enhancement (PBMGE) module, which progressively refines feature representations
> by enabling bidirectional interactions between gait and appearance streams
> across multiple spatial granularities, fully leveraging their complementarity
> to enhance global representations with rich local details and produce highly
> discriminative features. Extensive experiments on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets
> demonstrate the superiority of our approach, significantly outperforming
> existing state-of-the-art methods.
