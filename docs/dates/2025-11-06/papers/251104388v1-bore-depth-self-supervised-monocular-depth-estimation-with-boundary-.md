## 摘要（原文）

> Depth estimation is one of the key technologies for realizing 3D perception
> in unmanned systems. Monocular depth estimation has been widely researched
> because of its low-cost advantage, but the existing methods face the challenges
> of poor depth estimation performance and blurred object boundaries on embedded
> systems. In this paper, we propose a novel monocular depth estimation model,
> BoRe-Depth, which contains only 8.7M parameters. It can accurately estimate
> depth maps on embedded systems and significantly improves boundary quality.
> Firstly, we design an Enhanced Feature Adaptive Fusion Module (EFAF) which
> adaptively fuses depth features to enhance boundary detail representation.
> Secondly, we integrate semantic knowledge into the encoder to improve the
> object recognition and boundary perception capabilities. Finally, BoRe-Depth is
> deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, and runs efficiently at 50.7 FPS. We
> demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms previous
> lightweight models on multiple challenging datasets, and we provide detailed
> ablation studies for the proposed methods. The code is available at
> https://github.com/liangxiansheng093/BoRe-Depth.
