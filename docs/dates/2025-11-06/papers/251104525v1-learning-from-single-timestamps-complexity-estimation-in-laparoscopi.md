## 摘要（原文）

> Purpose: Accurate assessment of surgical complexity is essential in
> Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC), where severe inflammation is associated with
> longer operative times and increased risk of postoperative complications. The
> Parkland Grading Scale (PGS) provides a clinically validated framework for
> stratifying inflammation severity; however, its automation in surgical videos
> remains largely unexplored, particularly in realistic scenarios where complete
> videos must be analyzed without prior manual curation. Methods: In this work,
> we introduce STC-Net, a novel framework for SingleTimestamp-based Complexity
> estimation in LC via the PGS, designed to operate under weak temporal
> supervision. Unlike prior methods limited to static images or manually trimmed
> clips, STC-Net operates directly on full videos. It jointly performs temporal
> localization and grading through a localization, window proposal, and grading
> module. We introduce a novel loss formulation combining hard and soft
> localization objectives and background-aware grading supervision. Results:
> Evaluated on a private dataset of 1,859 LC videos, STC-Net achieves an accuracy
> of 62.11% and an F1-score of 61.42%, outperforming non-localized baselines by
> over 10% in both metrics and highlighting the effectiveness of weak supervision
> for surgical complexity assessment. Conclusion: STC-Net demonstrates a scalable
> and effective approach for automated PGS-based surgical complexity estimation
> from full LC videos, making it promising for post-operative analysis and
> surgical training.
