## 摘要（原文）

> The accurate delineation of tumours in radiological images like Computed
> Tomography is a very specialised and time-consuming task, and currently a
> bottleneck preventing quantitative analyses to be performed routinely in the
> clinical setting. For this reason, developing methods for the automated
> segmentation of tumours in medical imaging is of the utmost importance and has
> driven significant efforts in recent years. However, challenges regarding the
> impracticality of 3D scans, given the large amount of voxels to be analysed,
> usually requires the downsampling of such images or using patches thereof when
> applying traditional convolutional neural networks. To overcome this problem,
> in this paper we propose a new methodology that uses, divided into two stages,
> voxel sparsification and submanifold sparse convolutional networks. This method
> allows segmentations to be performed with high-resolution inputs and a native
> 3D model architecture, obtaining state-of-the-art accuracies while
> significantly reducing the computational resources needed in terms of GPU
> memory and time. We studied the deployment of this methodology in the context
> of Computed Tomography images of renal cancer patients from the KiTS23
> challenge, and our method achieved results competitive with the challenge
> winners, with Dice similarity coefficients of 95.8% for kidneys + masses, 85.7%
> for tumours + cysts, and 80.3% for tumours alone. Crucially, our method also
> offers significant computational improvements, achieving up to a 60% reduction
> in inference time and up to a 75\% reduction in VRAM usage compared to an
> equivalent dense architecture, across both CPU and various GPU cards tested.
