## 摘要（原文）

> Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, which measure changes in blood volume in
> the skin using light, have recently gained attention in biometric
> authentication because of their non-invasive acquisition, inherent liveness
> detection, and suitability for low-cost wearable devices. However, PPG signal
> quality is challenged by motion artifacts, illumination changes, and
> inter-subject physiological variability, making robust feature extraction and
> classification crucial. This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective
> biometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from
> low-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings
> from 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The
> raw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline
> drift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis
> (PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude
> normalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG
> segment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the
> Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient
> cardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed
> CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision
> Transformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long
> Short-Term Memory network (LSTM). The experimental results on 46 subjects
> demonstrate an authentication accuracy of 98%, validating the robustness of the
> model to noise and variability between subjects. Due to its efficiency,
> scalability, and inherent liveness detection capability, the proposed system is
> well-suited for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications.
