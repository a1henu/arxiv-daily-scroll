## 摘要（原文）

> Recent advances in text-to-video generation have achieved impressive
> perceptual quality, yet generated content often violates fundamental principles
> of physical plausibility - manifesting as implausible object dynamics,
> incoherent interactions, and unrealistic motion patterns. Such failures hinder
> the deployment of video generation models in embodied AI, robotics, and
> simulation-intensive domains. To bridge this gap, we propose PhysCorr, a
> unified framework for modeling, evaluating, and optimizing physical consistency
> in video generation. Specifically, we introduce PhysicsRM, the first
> dual-dimensional reward model that quantifies both intra-object stability and
> inter-object interactions. On this foundation, we develop PhyDPO, a novel
> direct preference optimization pipeline that leverages contrastive feedback and
> physics-aware reweighting to guide generation toward physically coherent
> outputs. Our approach is model-agnostic and scalable, enabling seamless
> integration into a wide range of video diffusion and transformer-based
> backbones. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
> PhysCorr achieves significant improvements in physical realism while preserving
> visual fidelity and semantic alignment. This work takes a critical step toward
> physically grounded and trustworthy video generation.
