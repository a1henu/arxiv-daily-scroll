## 摘要（原文）

> Empowering Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to deeply integrate image
> interaction with long-horizon reasoning capabilities remains a long-standing
> challenge in this field. Recent advances in vision-centric reasoning explore a
> promising "Thinking with Images" paradigm for LMMs, marking a shift from
> image-assisted reasoning to image-interactive thinking. While this milestone
> enables models to focus on fine-grained image regions, progress remains
> constrained by limited visual tool spaces and task-specific workflow designs.
> To bridge this gap, we present V-Thinker, a general-purpose multimodal
> reasoning assistant that enables interactive, vision-centric thinking through
> end-to-end reinforcement learning. V-Thinker comprises two key components: (1)
> a Data Evolution Flywheel that automatically synthesizes, evolves, and verifies
> interactive reasoning datasets across three dimensions-diversity, quality, and
> difficulty; and (2) a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum that first aligns
> perception via point-level supervision, then integrates interactive reasoning
> through a two-stage reinforcement learning framework. Furthermore, we introduce
> VTBench, an expert-verified benchmark targeting vision-centric interactive
> reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V-Thinker consistently
> outperforms strong LMM-based baselines in both general and interactive
> reasoning scenarios, providing valuable insights for advancing
> image-interactive reasoning applications.
