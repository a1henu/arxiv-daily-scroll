**一句话要点**：提出HideAndSeg工具，用于自然栖息地章鱼视频分割，减少手动干预。

**关键词**：视频分割, 无监督评估, 目标检测, SAM2集成, 章鱼行为研究

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：章鱼伪装、变形和遮挡导致自然栖息地视频分割困难，缺乏大规模标注数据。
- 方法要点：集成SAM2和YOLOv11，自动化生成分割掩码，无需持续手动提示。
- 实验或效果：引入无监督指标评估质量，在遮挡后仍能重识别和分割章鱼。

## 摘要（原文）

> Analyzing octopuses in their natural habitats is challenging due to their
> camouflage capability, rapid changes in skin texture and color, non-rigid body
> deformations, and frequent occlusions, all of which are compounded by variable
> underwater lighting and turbidity. Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated
> datasets, this paper introduces HideAndSeg, a novel, minimally supervised
> AI-based tool for segmenting videos of octopuses. It establishes a quantitative
> baseline for this task. HideAndSeg integrates SAM2 with a custom-trained
> YOLOv11 object detector. First, the user provides point coordinates to generate
> the initial segmentation masks with SAM2. These masks serve as training data
> for the YOLO model. After that, our approach fully automates the pipeline by
> providing a bounding box prompt to SAM2, eliminating the need for further
> manual intervention. We introduce two unsupervised metrics - temporal
> consistency $DICE_t$ and new component count $NC_t$ - to quantitatively
> evaluate segmentation quality and guide mask refinement in the absence of
> ground-truth data, i.e., real-world information that serves to train, validate,
> and test AI models. Results show that HideAndSeg achieves satisfactory
> performance, reducing segmentation noise compared to the manually prompted
> approach. Our method can re-identify and segment the octopus even after periods
> of complete occlusion in natural environments, a scenario in which the manually
> prompted model fails. By reducing the need for manual analysis in real-world
> scenarios, this work provides a practical tool that paves the way for more
> efficient behavioral studies of wild cephalopods.
