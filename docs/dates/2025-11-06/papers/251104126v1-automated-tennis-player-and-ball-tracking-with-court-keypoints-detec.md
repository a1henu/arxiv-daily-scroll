## 摘要（原文）

> This study presents a complete pipeline for automated tennis match analysis.
> Our framework integrates multiple deep learning models to detect and track
> players and the tennis ball in real time, while also identifying court
> keypoints for spatial reference. Using YOLOv8 for player detection, a
> custom-trained YOLOv5 model for ball tracking, and a ResNet50-based
> architecture for court keypoint detection, our system provides detailed
> analytics including player movement patterns, ball speed, shot accuracy, and
> player reaction times. The experimental results demonstrate robust performance
> in varying court conditions and match scenarios. The model outputs an annotated
> video along with detailed performance metrics, enabling coaches, broadcasters,
> and players to gain actionable insights into the dynamics of the game.
