## 摘要（原文）

> This paper does not introduce a novel architecture; instead, it revisits a
> fundamental yet overlooked baseline: adapting human-centric foundation models
> for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging. While landmark detection
> has traditionally relied on domain-specific models, the emergence of
> large-scale pre-trained vision models presents new opportunities. In this
> study, we investigate the adaptation of Sapiens, a human-centric foundation
> model designed for pose estimation, to medical imaging through multi-dataset
> pretraining, establishing a new state of the art across multiple datasets. Our
> proposed model, MedSapiens, demonstrates that human-centric foundation models,
> inherently optimized for spatial pose localization, provide strong priors for
> anatomical landmark detection, yet this potential has remained largely
> untapped. We benchmark MedSapiens against existing state-of-the-art models,
> achieving up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81%
> improvement over specialist models in the average success detection rate (SDR).
> To further assess MedSapiens adaptability to novel downstream tasks with few
> annotations, we evaluate its performance in limited-data settings, achieving
> 2.69% improvement over the few-shot state of the art in SDR. Code and model
> weights are available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/MedSapiens .
