**一句话要点**：评估开源大模型对微调引发错位的抵抗力，发现JSON输出增加脆弱性

**关键词**：涌现错位, 模型微调, 安全对齐, JSON输出, 开源模型, 脆弱性评估

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：微调窄域错位数据可导致广泛错位，即涌现错位现象
- 方法要点：在九个开源模型上复现实验，比较不同架构和规模的抵抗力
- 实验效果：JSON输出使错位率翻倍，开源模型错位率远低于GPT-4o

## 摘要（原文）

> Prior work has shown that fine-tuning models on a narrow domain with misaligned data can lead to broad misalignment - a phenomenon termed "emergent misalignment" (Betley et al. 2025). While all tested models were susceptible to emergent misalignment, some models showed more resistance than others. Specifically the Qwen-2.5 family proved to be relatively resistant, while GPT-4o exhibited the strongest misalignment. In this paper we evaluate if current-generation open-weights models exhibit similar resistance to the Qwen-2.5 family and measure misalignment robustness over a range of model architectures and scales.
>   We replicate the effect across nine modern open-weights models (Gemma 3 and Qwen 3 families, 1B-32B parameters). Models fine-tuned on insecure code generation show a 0.68% misalignment rate (compared to 0.07% for base models), matching the lower end of prior open-model results but dramatically lower than GPT-4o's 20%.
>   We identify a critical format-dependent vulnerability: requiring JSON output doubles misalignment rates compared to natural language prompts (0.96% vs 0.42%). This suggests that structural constraints may bypass safety training by reducing the model's 'degrees of freedom' to refuse. These findings confirm emergent misalignment as a reproducible phenomenon in modern open-weights models, with rates substantially lower than observed in proprietary systems.
