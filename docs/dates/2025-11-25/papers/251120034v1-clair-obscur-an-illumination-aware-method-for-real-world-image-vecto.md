- 引入内在图像分解，在向量域分离反照率、阴影和光照层
- 实验显示COVec在多个数据集上实现更高视觉保真度和可编辑性

## 摘要（原文）

> Image vectorization aims to convert raster images into editable, scalable vector representations while preserving visual fidelity. Existing vectorization methods struggle to represent complex real-world images, often producing fragmented shapes at the cost of semantic conciseness. In this paper, we propose COVec, an illumination-aware vectorization framework inspired by the Clair-Obscur principle of light-shade contrast. COVec is the first to introduce intrinsic image decomposition in the vector domain, separating an image into albedo, shade, and light layers in a unified vector representation. A semantic-guided initialization and two-stage optimization refine these layers with differentiable rendering. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that COVec achieves higher visual fidelity and significantly improved editability compared to existing methods.
