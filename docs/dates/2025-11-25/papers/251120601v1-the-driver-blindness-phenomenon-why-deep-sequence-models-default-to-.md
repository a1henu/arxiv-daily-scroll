**一句话要点**：提出Driver-Blindness现象以解决血糖预测中深度序列模型忽略临床驱动因素的问题

**关键词**：血糖预测, 序列模型, Driver-Blindness, 临床驱动因素, 模型评估

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：深度序列模型在血糖预测中忽视胰岛素等临床驱动因素，性能增益Δ_drivers接近零
- 方法要点：分析架构偏好自相关、数据保真度不足和生理异质性，提出特征编码和正则化策略
- 实验或效果：建议报告Δ_drivers以评估模型，部分策略可缓解Driver-Blindness

## 摘要（原文）

> Deep sequence models for blood glucose forecasting consistently fail to leverage clinically informative drivers--insulin, meals, and activity--despite well-understood physiological mechanisms. We term this Driver-Blindness and formalize it via $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$, the performance gain of multivariate models over matched univariate baselines. Across the literature, $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$ is typically near zero. We attribute this to three interacting factors: architectural biases favoring autocorrelation (C1), data fidelity gaps that render drivers noisy and confounded (C2), and physiological heterogeneity that undermines population-level models (C3). We synthesize strategies that partially mitigate Driver-Blindness--including physiological feature encoders, causal regularization, and personalization--and recommend that future work routinely report $Δ_{\text{drivers}}$ to prevent driver-blind models from being considered state-of-the-art.
