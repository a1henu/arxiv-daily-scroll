## 摘要（原文）

> The proactive prediction of anomalies (AP) in mul- tivariate time series (MTS) is a critical challenge to ensure system dependability. The difficulty lies in identifying subtle anomaly precursors concealed within normal signals. However, existing unsupervised methods, trained exclusively on normal data, demonstrate a fundamental propensity to reconstruct normal patterns. Consequently, when confronted with weak precursors, their predictions are dominated by the normal pattern, submerging the very signal required for prediction. To contend with the limitation, we propose RED-F, a Reconstruction- Elimination based Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting frame- work, comprising the Reconstruction-Elimination Model (REM) and the Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting Model (DFM). The REM utilizes a hybrid time-frequency mechanism to mitigate the precursor, generating a purified, normal-pattern baseline. The DFM then receives this purified baseline and the original sequence which retains the precursor as parallel inputs. At the core of our framework, RED-F employs a contrastive forecast that transforms the difficult task of absolute signal detection into a simpler, more robust task of relative trajectory comparison by computing the divergence between these two predictive streams. This contrastive mechanism serves to amplify the faint precursor signal. Furthermore, the DFM is trained with a novel Multi-Series Prediction (MSP) objective, which leverages distant future con- text to enhance its predictive sensitivity. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the superior capability of RED-F in anomaly prediction tasks.
