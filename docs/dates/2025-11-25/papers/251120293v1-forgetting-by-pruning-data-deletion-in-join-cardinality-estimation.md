## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：多表关系数据中数据删除导致属性敏感、表间传播和域消失，引发严重高估
- 方法要点：引入分布敏感剪枝和域剪枝，构建半连接删除结果并指导参数剪枝
- 实验或效果：在IMDB和TPC-H数据集上CEP实现最低Q误差，计算开销仅0.3%-2.5%

## 摘要（原文）

> Machine unlearning in learned cardinality estimation (CE) systems presents unique challenges due to the complex distributional dependencies in multi-table relational data. Specifically, data deletion, a core component of machine unlearning, faces three critical challenges in learned CE models: attribute-level sensitivity, inter-table propagation and domain disappearance leading to severe overestimation in multi-way joins. We propose Cardinality Estimation Pruning (CEP), the first unlearning framework specifically designed for multi-table learned CE systems. CEP introduces Distribution Sensitivity Pruning, which constructs semi-join deletion results and computes sensitivity scores to guide parameter pruning, and Domain Pruning, which removes support for value domains entirely eliminated by deletion. We evaluate CEP on state-of-the-art architectures NeuroCard and FACE across IMDB and TPC-H datasets. Results demonstrate CEP consistently achieves the lowest Q-error in multi-table scenarios, particularly under high deletion ratios, often outperforming full retraining. Furthermore, CEP significantly reduces convergence iterations, incurring negligible computational overhead of 0.3%-2.5% of fine-tuning time.
