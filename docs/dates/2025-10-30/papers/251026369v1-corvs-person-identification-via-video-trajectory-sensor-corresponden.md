**作者**：Kazuma Kano, Yuki Mori, Shin Katayama, Kenta Urano, Takuro Yonezawa, Nobuo Kawaguchi  

**一句话要点**：提出CorVS方法，通过视频轨迹与传感器对应关系解决真实仓库中人员识别问题

**关键词**：人员识别, 视频轨迹, 传感器测量, 深度学习, 仓库监控, 数据对应

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：仅凭视觉数据在真实仓库中识别个体不实用，现有方法在现实条件下易失效
- 方法要点：使用深度学习预测轨迹与传感器测量的对应概率和可靠性，并随时间匹配
- 实验或效果：基于实际仓库操作数据集验证，证明方法在真实应用中的有效性

## 摘要（原文）

> Worker location data is key to higher productivity in industrial sites.
> Cameras are a promising tool for localization in logistics warehouses since
> they also offer valuable environmental contexts such as package status.
> However, identifying individuals with only visual data is often impractical.
> Accordingly, several prior studies identified people in videos by comparing
> their trajectories and wearable sensor measurements. While this approach has
> advantages such as independence from appearance, the existing methods may break
> down under real-world conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose CorVS,
> a novel data-driven person identification method based on correspondence
> between visual tracking trajectories and sensor measurements. Firstly, our deep
> learning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for
> every pair of a trajectory and sensor measurements. Secondly, our algorithm
> matches the trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted
> probabilities and reliabilities. We developed a dataset with actual warehouse
> operations and demonstrated the method's effectiveness for real-world
> applications.
