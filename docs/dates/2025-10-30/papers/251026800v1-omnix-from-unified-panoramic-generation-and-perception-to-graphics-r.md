**作者**：Yukun Huang, Jiwen Yu, Yanning Zhou, Jianan Wang, Xintao Wang, Pengfei Wan, Xihui Liu  

**一句话要点**：提出OmniX框架，从全景生成与感知生成图形就绪3D场景

**关键词**：全景生成, 3D场景生成, 物理渲染, 跨模态适配器, 全景感知, 合成数据集

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：现有2D提升方法忽略内在属性感知，无法生成适合物理渲染的3D场景。
- 方法要点：基于跨模态适配器，复用2D生成先验进行全景几何、纹理和PBR材料感知。
- 实验或效果：构建大规模合成全景数据集，验证模型在感知和生成图形就绪3D场景的有效性。

## 摘要（原文）

> There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
> and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
> promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
> immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
> this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically
> based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to
> repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,
> and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize
> appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we
> present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and
> efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for
> a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,
> generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic
> panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse
> indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
> of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene
> generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic
> virtual world generation.
