**作者**：Aniruddh Bansal, Davit Soselia, Dang Nguyen, Tianyi Zhou  

**一句话要点**：提出ChartAB基准以评估视觉语言模型在图表细粒度对齐与比较中的能力

**关键词**：图表理解, 视觉语言模型评估, 细粒度对齐, 基准测试, 多图表比较, JSON模板

## 3 点简述
- 现有视觉语言模型在图表细节感知和细粒度结构提取方面存在不足
- 设计JSON模板和两阶段推理工作流，支持图表元素定位、属性识别和跨图表比较
- 评估揭示模型在图表理解中的感知偏差、弱点和幻觉，提供改进方向

## 摘要（原文）

> Charts play an important role in visualization, reasoning, data analysis, and
> the exchange of ideas among humans. However, existing vision-language models
> (VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract
> fine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also
> hinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this
> paper, we introduce a novel "ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)" to provide a
> comprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting
> tabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various
> attributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON
> template to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically
> tailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference
> workflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and
> compare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on
> several recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,
> weaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These
> findings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart
> understanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened
> in current models.
