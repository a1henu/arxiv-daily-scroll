**一句话要点**：提出Thor框架以解决人形机器人在密集接触环境中的全身反应问题

**关键词**：人形机器人, 强化学习, 力自适应控制, 全身反应, 密集接触环境

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：人形机器人在密集接触环境中难以生成类人自适应反应，维持全身稳定性。
- 方法要点：设计力自适应躯干倾斜奖励函数，并采用强化学习架构解耦上体、腰部和下体控制。
- 实验或效果：在Unitree G1上部署，拉力任务中性能提升68.9%至74.7%，能拉动130N负载和单手开60N防火门。

## 摘要（原文）

> Humanoids hold great potential for service, industrial, and rescue
> applications, in which robots must sustain whole-body stability while
> performing intense, contact-rich interactions with the environment. However,
> enabling humanoids to generate human-like, adaptive responses under such
> conditions remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Thor, a
> humanoid framework for human-level whole-body reactions in contact-rich
> environments. Based on the robot's force analysis, we design a force-adaptive
> torso-tilt (FAT2) reward function to encourage humanoids to exhibit human-like
> responses during force-interaction tasks. To mitigate the high-dimensional
> challenges of humanoid control, Thor introduces a reinforcement learning
> architecture that decouples the upper body, waist, and lower body. Each
> component shares global observations of the whole body and jointly updates its
> parameters. Finally, we deploy Thor on the Unitree G1, and it substantially
> outperforms baselines in force-interaction tasks. Specifically, the robot
> achieves a peak pulling force of 167.7 N (approximately 48% of the G1's body
> weight) when moving backward and 145.5 N when moving forward, representing
> improvements of 68.9% and 74.7%, respectively, compared with the
> best-performing baseline. Moreover, Thor is capable of pulling a loaded rack
> (130 N) and opening a fire door with one hand (60 N). These results highlight
> Thor's effectiveness in enhancing humanoid force-interaction capabilities.
