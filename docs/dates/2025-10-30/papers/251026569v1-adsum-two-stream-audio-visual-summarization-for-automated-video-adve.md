**一句话要点**：提出双流音视频融合模型以自动化视频广告剪辑

**关键词**：视频广告剪辑, 双流融合模型, 音视频摘要, 帧重要性预测, AdSum204数据集

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：传统广告剪辑依赖人工，耗时费力，需自动生成多时长版本。
- 方法要点：采用双流音视频融合模型预测帧重要性，强调音频在广告中的作用。
- 实验或效果：在AdSum204数据集上，模型在多项指标上优于现有方法。

## 摘要（原文）

> Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at
> varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves
> manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter
> versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
> introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization
> techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection
> problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video
> summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach
> emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we
> develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of
> video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being
> selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific
> datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of
> 30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive
> experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods
> across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve,
> Spearman, and Kendall.
