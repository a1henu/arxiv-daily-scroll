## 摘要（原文）

> Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) methods identify anomalous regions with few
> known normal samples. Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability
> of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous
> regions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.
> However, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can
> only pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to
> identify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment
> between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving
> sub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose
> the Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and
> fine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with
> automatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel
> framework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,
> which consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and
> Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics
> into multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and
> concatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and
> multi-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align
> with corresponding visual regions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
> FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on
> MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.
