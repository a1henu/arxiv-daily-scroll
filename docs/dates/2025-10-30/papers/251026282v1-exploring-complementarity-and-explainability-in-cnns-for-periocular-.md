## 摘要（原文）

> We study the complementarity of different CNNs for periocular verification at
> different distances on the UBIPr database. We train three architectures of
> increasing complexity (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, and ResNet50) on a large set of
> eye crops from VGGFace2. We analyse performance with cosine and chi2 metrics,
> compare different network initialisations, and apply score-level fusion via
> logistic regression. In addition, we use LIME heatmaps and Jensen-Shannon
> divergence to compare attention patterns of the CNNs. While ResNet50
> consistently performs best individually, the fusion provides substantial gains,
> especially when combining all three networks. Heatmaps show that networks
> usually focus on distinct regions of a given image, which explains their
> complementarity. Our method significantly outperforms previous works on UBIPr,
> achieving a new state-of-the-art.
