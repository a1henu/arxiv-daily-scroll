**一句话要点**：提出两种场景信息融合方法以提升遮挡物体分类性能

**关键词**：遮挡物体识别, 场景上下文融合, RPN-DCNN网络, 多训练策略, 物体检测鲁棒性

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：遮挡导致物体识别算法性能下降，需额外信息增强鲁棒性。
- 方法要点：基于场景上下文，在预测前选择定制网络或检测后融合场景知识。
- 实验或效果：在遮挡数据集上，召回率和精确率均优于基线方法。

## 摘要（原文）

> The presence of occlusions has provided substantial challenges to
> typically-powerful object recognition algorithms. Additional sources of
> information can be extremely valuable to reduce errors caused by occlusions.
> Scene context is known to aid in object recognition in biological vision. In
> this work, we attempt to add robustness into existing Region Proposal
> Network-Deep Convolutional Neural Network (RPN-DCNN) object detection networks
> through two distinct scene-based information fusion techniques. We present one
> algorithm under each methodology: the first operates prior to prediction,
> selecting a custom object network to use based on the identified background
> scene, and the second operates after detection, fusing scene knowledge into
> initial object scores output by the RPN. We demonstrate our algorithms on
> challenging datasets featuring partial occlusions, which show overall
> improvement in both recall and precision against baseline methods. In addition,
> our experiments contrast multiple training methodologies for occlusion
> handling, finding that training on a combination of both occluded and
> unoccluded images demonstrates an improvement over the others. Our method is
> interpretable and can easily be adapted to other datasets, offering many future
> directions for research and practical applications.
