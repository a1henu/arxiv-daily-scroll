## 摘要（原文）

> Remote sensing image scene classification remains a challenging task,
> primarily due to the complex spatial structures and multi-scale characteristics
> of ground objects. Existing approaches see CNNs excel at modeling local
> textures, while Transformers excel at capturing global context. However,
> efficiently integrating them remains a bottleneck due to the high computational
> cost of Transformers. To tackle this, we propose AFM-Net, a novel Advanced
> Hierarchical Fusing framework that achieves effective local and global
> co-representation through two pathways: a CNN branch for extracting
> hierarchical visual priors, and a Mamba branch for efficient global sequence
> modeling. The core innovation of AFM-Net lies in its Hierarchical Fusion
> Mechanism, which progressively aggregates multi-scale features from both
> pathways, enabling dynamic cross-level feature interaction and contextual
> reconstruction to produce highly discriminative representations. These fused
> features are then adaptively routed through a Mixture-of-Experts classifier
> module, which dispatches them to the most suitable experts for fine-grained
> scene recognition. Experiments on AID, NWPU-RESISC45, and UC Merced show that
> AFM-Net obtains 93.72, 95.54, and 96.92 percent accuracy, surpassing
> state-of-the-art methods with balanced performance and efficiency. Code is
