**一句话要点**：提出暗场X射线成像结合深度学习，提高小鼠早期肺肿瘤检测性能

**关键词**：暗场X射线成像, 深度学习分割, 肺肿瘤检测, U-Net网络, 合成肿瘤生成

## 3 点简述
- 低剂量CT筛查肺癌存在假阳性高和可及性差的问题

- 暗场成像模型敏感度达83.7%，优于标准衰减成像的51%

## 摘要（原文）

> Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is the current standard for lung cancer
> screening, yet its adoption and accessibility remain limited. Many regions lack
> LDCT infrastructure, and even among those screened, early-stage cancer
> detection often yield false positives, as shown in the National Lung Screening
> Trial (NLST) with a sensitivity of 93.8 percent and a false-positive rate of
> 26.6 percent. We aim to investigate whether X-ray dark-field imaging (DFI)
> radiograph, a technique sensitive to small-angle scatter from alveolar
> microstructure and less susceptible to organ shadowing, can significantly
> improve early-stage lung tumor detection when coupled with deep-learning
> segmentation. Using paired attenuation (ATTN) and DFI radiograph images of
> euthanized mouse lungs, we generated realistic synthetic tumors with irregular
> boundaries and intensity profiles consistent with physical lung contrast. A
> U-Net segmentation network was trained on small patches using either ATTN, DFI,
> or a combination of ATTN and DFI channels.Results show that the DFI-only model
> achieved a true-positive detection rate of 83.7 percent, compared with 51
> percent for ATTN-only, while maintaining comparable specificity (90.5 versus
> 92.9 percent). The combined ATTN and DFI input achieved 79.6 percent
> sensitivity and 97.6 percent specificity. In conclusion, DFI substantially
> improves early-tumor detectability in comparison to standard attenuation
> radiography and shows potential as an accessible, low-cost, low-dose
> alternative for pre-clinical or limited-resource screening where LDCT is
> unavailable.
