## 摘要（原文）

> Multi-embodiment grasping focuses on developing approaches that exhibit
> generalist behavior across diverse gripper designs. Existing methods often
> learn the kinematic structure of the robot implicitly and face challenges due
> to the difficulty of sourcing the required large-scale data. In this work, we
> present a data-efficient, flow-based, equivariant grasp synthesis architecture
> that can handle different gripper types with variable degrees of freedom and
> successfully exploit the underlying kinematic model, deducing all necessary
> information solely from the gripper and scene geometry. Unlike previous
> equivariant grasping methods, we translated all modules from the ground up to
> JAX and provide a model with batching capabilities over scenes, grippers, and
> grasps, resulting in smoother learning, improved performance and faster
> inference time. Our dataset encompasses grippers ranging from humanoid hands to
> parallel yaw grippers and includes 25,000 scenes and 20 million grasps.
