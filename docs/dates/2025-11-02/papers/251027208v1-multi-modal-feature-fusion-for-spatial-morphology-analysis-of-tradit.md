## 摘要（原文）

> Villages areas hold significant importance in the study of human-land
> relationships. However, with the advancement of urbanization, the gradual
> disappearance of spatial characteristics and the homogenization of landscapes
> have emerged as prominent issues. Existing studies primarily adopt a
> single-disciplinary perspective to analyze villages spatial morphology and its
> influencing factors, relying heavily on qualitative analysis methods. These
> efforts are often constrained by the lack of digital infrastructure and
> insufficient data. To address the current research limitations, this paper
> proposes a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model that integrates
> multi-source data to conduct an in-depth analysis of villages spatial
> morphology. The framework includes two types of nodes-input nodes and
> communication nodes-and two types of edges-static input edges and dynamic
> communication edges. By combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph
> Attention Networks (GAT), the proposed model efficiently integrates multimodal
> features under a two-stage feature update mechanism. Additionally, based on
> existing principles for classifying villages spatial morphology, the paper
> introduces a relational pooling mechanism and implements a joint training
> strategy across 17 subtypes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method
> achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches in
> multimodal fusion and classification tasks. Additionally, the proposed joint
> optimization of all sub-types lifts mean accuracy/F1 from 0.71/0.83
> (independent models) to 0.82/0.90, driven by a 6% gain for parcel tasks. Our
> method provides scientific evidence for exploring villages spatial patterns and
> generative logic.
