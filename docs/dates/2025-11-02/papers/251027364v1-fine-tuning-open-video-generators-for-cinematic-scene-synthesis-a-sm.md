## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：如何从小数据集高效微调开源视频扩散模型，生成影视级场景。
- 方法要点：两阶段流程，先使用LoRA学习视觉风格，再扩展为连贯视频序列。
- 实验或效果：评估显示在电影保真度和时间稳定性上优于基础模型。

## 摘要（原文）

> We present a practical pipeline for fine-tuning open-source video diffusion
> transformers to synthesize cinematic scenes for television and film production
> from small datasets. The proposed two-stage process decouples visual style
> learning from motion generation. In the first stage, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
> modules are integrated into the cross-attention layers of the Wan2.1 I2V-14B
> model to adapt its visual representations using a compact dataset of short
> clips from Ay Yapim's historical television film El Turco. This enables
> efficient domain transfer within hours on a single GPU. In the second stage,
> the fine-tuned model produces stylistically consistent keyframes that preserve
> costume, lighting, and color grading, which are then temporally expanded into
> coherent 720p sequences through the model's video decoder. We further apply
> lightweight parallelization and sequence partitioning strategies to accelerate
> inference without quality degradation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
> using FVD, CLIP-SIM, and LPIPS metrics, supported by a small expert user study,
> demonstrate measurable improvements in cinematic fidelity and temporal
> stability over the base model. The complete training and inference pipeline is
> released to support reproducibility and adaptation across cinematic domains.
