**作者**：Alik Pramanick, Mayank Bansal, Utkarsh Srivastava, Suklav Ghosh, Arijit Sur  

**一句话要点**：提出基于Transformer的空间-频率域去噪方法以防御图像对抗攻击

**关键词**：对抗防御, 图像去噪, Transformer, 空间-频率域, 离散小波变换, 深度神经网络

## 3 点简述
- 深度神经网络易受对抗攻击，限制其在安全关键系统中的应用
- 采用两阶段训练：先训练去噪网络，再训练分类器；结合空间和频率域特征
- 在MNIST等数据集上显著提升分类准确率，优于现有去噪和对抗训练方法

## 摘要（原文）

> In recent times, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been successfully adopted
> for various applications. Despite their notable achievements, it has become
> evident that DNNs are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks,
> restricting their applications in security-critical systems. In this paper, we
> present two-phase training methods to tackle the attack: first, training the
> denoising network, and second, the deep classifier model. We propose a novel
> denoising strategy that integrates both spatial and frequency domain approaches
> to defend against adversarial attacks on images. Our analysis reveals that
> high-frequency components of attacked images are more severely corrupted
> compared to their lower-frequency counterparts. To address this, we leverage
> Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for frequency analysis and develop a denoising
> network that combines spatial image features with wavelets through a
> transformer layer. Next, we retrain the classifier using the denoised images,
> which enhances the classifier's robustness against adversarial attacks.
> Experimental results across the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Fashion-MNIST datasets
> reveal that the proposed method remarkably elevates classification accuracy,
> substantially exceeding the performance by utilizing a denoising network and
> adversarial training approaches. The code is available at
