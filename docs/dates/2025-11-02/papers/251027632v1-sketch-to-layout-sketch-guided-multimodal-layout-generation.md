## 摘要（原文）

> Graphic layout generation is a growing research area focusing on generating
> aesthetically pleasing layouts ranging from poster designs to documents. While
> recent research has explored ways to incorporate user constraints to guide the
> layout generation, these constraints often require complex specifications which
> reduce usability. We introduce an innovative approach exploiting user-provided
> sketches as intuitive constraints and we demonstrate empirically the
> effectiveness of this new guidance method, establishing the sketch-to-layout
> problem as a promising research direction, which is currently under-explored.
> To tackle the sketch-to-layout problem, we propose a multimodal
> transformer-based solution using the sketch and the content assets as inputs to
> produce high quality layouts. Since collecting sketch training data from human
> annotators to train our model is very costly, we introduce a novel and
> efficient method to synthetically generate training sketches at scale. We train
> and evaluate our model on three publicly available datasets: PubLayNet,
> DocLayNet and SlidesVQA, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art
> constraint-based methods, while offering a more intuitive design experience. In
> order to facilitate future sketch-to-layout research, we release O(200k)
> synthetically-generated sketches for the public datasets above. The datasets
> are available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/sketch_to_layout.
