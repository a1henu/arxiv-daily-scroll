## 摘要（原文）

> Whole slide image (WSI) analysis has emerged as an increasingly essential
> technique in computational pathology. Recent advances in the pathological
> foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in deriving
> meaningful patch-level or slide-level feature representations from WSIs.
> However, current pathological FMs have exhibited substantial heterogeneity
> caused by diverse private training datasets and different network
> architectures. This heterogeneity introduces performance variability when we
> utilize the extracted features from different FMs in the downstream tasks. To
> fully explore the advantage of multiple FMs effectively, in this work, we
> propose a novel framework for the fusion of heterogeneous pathological FMs,
> called FuseCPath, yielding a model with a superior ensemble performance. The
> main contributions of our framework can be summarized as follows: (i) To
> guarantee the representativeness of the training patches, we propose a
> multi-view clustering-based method to filter out the discriminative patches via
> multiple FMs' embeddings. (ii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous
> patch-level FMs, we devise a cluster-level re-embedding strategy to online
> capture patch-level local features. (iii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous
> slide-level FMs, we devise a collaborative distillation strategy to explore the
> connections between slide-level FMs. Extensive experiments conducted on lung
> cancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome
> Atlas (TCGA) have demonstrated that the proposed FuseCPath achieves
> state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on these public datasets.
