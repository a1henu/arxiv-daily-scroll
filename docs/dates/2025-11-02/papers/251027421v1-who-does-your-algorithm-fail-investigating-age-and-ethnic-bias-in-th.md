**一句话要点**：评估MAMA-MIA数据集在年龄和种族上的分割偏见，揭示年轻患者的内在偏见

**关键词**：图像分割偏见, 医疗公平性, 年龄偏见, 种族偏见, 数据集审计, 乳腺癌诊断

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：深度学习分割模型在乳腺癌肿瘤分割中可能存在年龄和种族偏见，影响医疗公平性。
- 方法要点：审计MAMA-MIA数据集自动分割标签的公平性，分析年龄、种族和数据源的影响。
- 实验或效果：发现年轻患者存在内在年龄偏见，且多数据源聚合影响种族偏见，强调细粒度分析必要性。

## 摘要（原文）

> Deep learning models aim to improve diagnostic workflows, but fairness
> evaluation remains underexplored beyond classification, e.g., in image
> segmentation. Unaddressed segmentation bias can lead to disparities in the
> quality of care for certain populations, potentially compounded across clinical
> decision points and amplified through iterative model development. Here, we
> audit the fairness of the automated segmentation labels provided in the breast
> cancer tumor segmentation dataset MAMA-MIA. We evaluate automated segmentation
> quality across age, ethnicity, and data source. Our analysis reveals an
> intrinsic age-related bias against younger patients that continues to persist
> even after controlling for confounding factors, such as data source. We
> hypothesize that this bias may be linked to physiological factors, a known
> challenge for both radiologists and automated systems. Finally, we show how
> aggregating data from multiple data sources influences site-specific ethnic
> biases, underscoring the necessity of investigating data at a granular level.
