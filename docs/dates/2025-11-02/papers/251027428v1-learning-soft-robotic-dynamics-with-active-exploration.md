- 在仿真和真实平台上验证，模型更准确，零样本控制性能优越

## 摘要（原文）

> Soft robots offer unmatched adaptability and safety in unstructured
> environments, yet their compliant, high-dimensional, and nonlinear dynamics
> make modeling for control notoriously difficult. Existing data-driven
> approaches often fail to generalize, constrained by narrowly focused task
> demonstrations or inefficient random exploration. We introduce SoftAE, an
> uncertainty-aware active exploration framework that autonomously learns
> task-agnostic and generalizable dynamics models of soft robotic systems. SoftAE
> employs probabilistic ensemble models to estimate epistemic uncertainty and
> actively guides exploration toward underrepresented regions of the state-action
> space, achieving efficient coverage of diverse behaviors without task-specific
> supervision. We evaluate SoftAE on three simulated soft robotic platforms -- a
> continuum arm, an articulated fish in fluid, and a musculoskeletal leg with
> hybrid actuation -- and on a pneumatically actuated continuum soft arm in the
> real world. Compared with random exploration and task-specific model-based
> reinforcement learning, SoftAE produces more accurate dynamics models, enables
> superior zero-shot control on unseen tasks, and maintains robustness under
> sensing noise, actuation delays, and nonlinear material effects. These results
> demonstrate that uncertainty-driven active exploration can yield scalable,
> reusable dynamics models across diverse soft robotic morphologies, representing
> a step toward more autonomous, adaptable, and data-efficient control in
> compliant robots.
