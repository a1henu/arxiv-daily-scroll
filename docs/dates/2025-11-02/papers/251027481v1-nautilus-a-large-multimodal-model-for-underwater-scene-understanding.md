## 摘要（原文）

> Underwater exploration offers critical insights into our planet and attracts
> increasing attention for its broader applications in resource exploration,
> national security, etc. We study the underwater scene understanding methods,
> which aim to achieve automated underwater exploration. The underwater scene
> understanding task demands multi-task perceptions from multiple granularities.
> However, the absence of large-scale underwater multi-task instruction-tuning
> datasets hinders the progress of this research. To bridge this gap, we
> construct NautData, a dataset containing 1.45 M image-text pairs supporting
> eight underwater scene understanding tasks. It enables the development and
> thorough evaluation of the underwater scene understanding models. Underwater
> image degradation is a widely recognized challenge that interferes with
> underwater tasks. To improve the robustness of underwater scene understanding,
> we introduce physical priors derived from underwater imaging models and propose
> a plug-and-play vision feature enhancement (VFE) module, which explicitly
> restores clear underwater information. We integrate this module into renowned
> baselines LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen2.5-VL and build our underwater LMM, NAUTILUS.
> Experiments conducted on the NautData and public underwater datasets
> demonstrate the effectiveness of the VFE module, consistently improving the
> performance of both baselines on the majority of supported tasks, thus ensuring
> the superiority of NAUTILUS in the underwater scene understanding area. Data
> and models are available at https://github.com/H-EmbodVis/NAUTILUS.
