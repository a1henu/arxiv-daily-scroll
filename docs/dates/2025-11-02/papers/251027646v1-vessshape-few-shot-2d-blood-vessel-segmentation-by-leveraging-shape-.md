## 摘要（原文）

> Semantic segmentation of blood vessels is an important task in medical image
> analysis, but its progress is often hindered by the scarcity of large annotated
> datasets and the poor generalization of models across different imaging
> modalities. A key aspect is the tendency of Convolutional Neural Networks
> (CNNs) to learn texture-based features, which limits their performance when
> applied to new domains with different visual characteristics. We hypothesize
> that leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes, such as their tubular and
> branching nature, can lead to more robust and data-efficient models. To
> investigate this, we introduce VessShape, a methodology for generating
> large-scale 2D synthetic datasets designed to instill a shape bias in
> segmentation models. VessShape images contain procedurally generated tubular
> geometries combined with a wide variety of foreground and background textures,
> encouraging models to learn shape cues rather than textures. We demonstrate
> that a model pre-trained on VessShape images achieves strong few-shot
> segmentation performance on two real-world datasets from different domains,
> requiring only four to ten samples for fine-tuning. Furthermore, the model
> exhibits notable zero-shot capabilities, effectively segmenting vessels in
> unseen domains without any target-specific training. Our results indicate that
> pre-training with a strong shape bias can be an effective strategy to overcome
> data scarcity and improve model generalization in blood vessel segmentation.
