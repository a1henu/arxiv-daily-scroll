## 摘要（原文）

> Historical maps are unique and valuable archives that document geographic
> features across different time periods. However, automated analysis of
> historical map images remains a significant challenge due to their wide
> stylistic variability and the scarcity of annotated training data. Constructing
> linked spatio-temporal datasets from historical map time series is even more
> time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it requires synthesizing information
> from multiple maps. Such datasets are essential for applications such as dating
> buildings, analyzing the development of road networks and settlements, studying
> environmental changes etc. We present MapSAM2, a unified framework for
> automatically segmenting both historical map images and time series. Built on a
> visual foundation model, MapSAM2 adapts to diverse segmentation tasks with
> few-shot fine-tuning. Our key innovation is to treat both historical map images
> and time series as videos. For images, we process a set of tiles as a video,
> enabling the memory attention mechanism to incorporate contextual cues from
> similar tiles, leading to improved geometric accuracy, particularly for areal
> features. For time series, we introduce the annotated Siegfried Building Time
> Series Dataset and, to reduce annotation costs, propose generating pseudo time
> series from single-year maps by simulating common temporal transformations.
> Experimental results show that MapSAM2 learns temporal associations effectively
> and can accurately segment and link buildings in time series under limited
> supervision or using pseudo videos. We will release both our dataset and code
> to support future research.
