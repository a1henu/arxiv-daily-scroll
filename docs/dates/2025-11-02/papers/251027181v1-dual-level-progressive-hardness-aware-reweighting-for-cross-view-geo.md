**关键词**：跨视角地理定位, 硬负样本挖掘, 损失重加权, 渐进学习, 无人机-卫星图像匹配

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：跨视角地理定位因视角差异和硬负样本导致训练不稳定和收敛困难
- 方法要点：结合样本级难度感知重加权和批级渐进损失加权，动态调整样本权重
- 实验或效果：在University-1652和SUES-200基准上优于现有方法，提升鲁棒性

## 摘要（原文）

> Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) between drone and satellite imagery
> remains challenging due to severe viewpoint gaps and the presence of hard
> negatives, which are visually similar but geographically mismatched samples.
> Existing mining or reweighting strategies often use static weighting, which is
> sensitive to distribution shifts and prone to overemphasizing difficult samples
> too early, leading to noisy gradients and unstable convergence. In this paper,
> we present a Dual-level Progressive Hardness-aware Reweighting (DPHR) strategy.
> At the sample level, a Ratio-based Difficulty-Aware (RDA) module evaluates
> relative difficulty and assigns fine-grained weights to negatives. At the batch
> level, a Progressive Adaptive Loss Weighting (PALW) mechanism exploits a
> training-progress signal to attenuate noisy gradients during early optimization
> and progressively enhance hard-negative mining as training matures. Experiments
> on the University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
> and robustness of the proposed DPHR, achieving consistent improvements over
> state-of-the-art methods.
