## 摘要（原文）

> Three-dimensional scene generation holds significant potential in gaming,
> film, and virtual reality. However, most existing methods adopt a single-step
> generation process, making it difficult to balance scene complexity with
> minimal user input. Inspired by the human cognitive process in scene modeling,
> which progresses from global to local, focuses on key elements, and completes
> the scene through semantic association, we propose HiGS, a hierarchical
> generative framework for multi-step associative semantic spatial composition.
> HiGS enables users to iteratively expand scenes by selecting key semantic
> objects, offering fine-grained control over regions of interest while the model
> completes peripheral areas automatically. To support structured and coherent
> generation, we introduce the Progressive Hierarchical Spatial-Semantic Graph
> (PHiSSG), which dynamically organizes spatial relationships and semantic
> dependencies across the evolving scene structure. PHiSSG ensures spatial and
> geometric consistency throughout the generation process by maintaining a
> one-to-one mapping between graph nodes and generated objects and supporting
> recursive layout optimization. Experiments demonstrate that HiGS outperforms
> single-stage methods in layout plausibility, style consistency, and user
> preference, offering a controllable and extensible paradigm for efficient 3D
> scene construction.
