## 摘要（原文）

> In orthodontic treatment, particularly within telemedicine contexts,
> observing patients' dental occlusion from multiple viewpoints facilitates
> timely clinical decision-making. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting
> (3DGS) have shown strong potential in 3D reconstruction and novel view
> synthesis. However, conventional 3DGS pipelines typically rely on densely
> captured multi-view inputs and precisely initialized camera poses, limiting
> their practicality. Orthodontic cases, in contrast, often comprise only three
> sparse images, specifically, the anterior view and bilateral buccal views,
> rendering the reconstruction task especially challenging. The extreme sparsity
> of input views severely degrades reconstruction quality, while the absence of
> camera pose information further complicates the process. To overcome these
> limitations, we propose DentalSplat, an effective framework for 3D
> reconstruction from sparse orthodontic imagery. Our method leverages a
> prior-guided dense stereo reconstruction model to initialize the point cloud,
> followed by a scale-adaptive pruning strategy to improve the training
> efficiency and reconstruction quality of 3DGS. In scenarios with extremely
> sparse viewpoints, we further incorporate optical flow as a geometric
> constraint, coupled with gradient regularization, to enhance rendering
> fidelity. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset comprising 950
> clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases designed to
> simulate real-world remote orthodontic imaging conditions. Experimental results
> demonstrate that our method effectively handles sparse input scenarios and
> achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion
> visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.
