## 摘要（原文）

> Entropy Minimization (EM) is beneficial to reducing class overlap, bridging
> domain gap, and restricting uncertainty for various tasks in machine learning,
> yet its potential is limited. To study the internal mechanism of EM, we
> reformulate and decouple the classical EM into two parts with opposite effects:
> cluster aggregation driving factor (CADF) rewards dominant classes and prompts
> a peaked output distribution, while gradient mitigation calibrator (GMC)
> penalizes high-confidence classes based on predicted probabilities.
> Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of classical EM caused by its coupled
> formulation: 1) reward collapse impedes the contribution of high-certainty
> samples in the learning process, and 2) easy-class bias induces misalignment
> between output distribution and label distribution. To address these issues, we
> propose Adaptive Decoupled Entropy Minimization (AdaDEM), which normalizes the
> reward brought from CADF and employs a marginal entropy calibrator (MEC) to
> replace GMC. AdaDEM outperforms DEM*, an upper-bound variant of classical EM,
> and achieves superior performance across various imperfectly supervised
> learning tasks in noisy and dynamic environments.
