## 摘要（原文）

> Safe multi-agent motion planning (MAMP) under task-induced constraints is a
> critical challenge in robotics. Many real-world scenarios require robots to
> navigate dynamic environments while adhering to manifold constraints imposed by
> tasks. For example, service robots must carry cups upright while avoiding
> collisions with humans or other robots. Despite recent advances in
> decentralized MAMP for high-dimensional systems, incorporating manifold
> constraints remains difficult. To address this, we propose a
> manifold-constrained Hamilton-Jacobi reachability (HJR) learning framework for
> decentralized MAMP. Our method solves HJR problems under manifold constraints
> to capture task-aware safety conditions, which are then integrated into a
> decentralized trajectory optimization planner. This enables robots to generate
> motion plans that are both safe and task-feasible without requiring assumptions
> about other agents' policies. Our approach generalizes across diverse
> manifold-constrained tasks and scales effectively to high-dimensional
> multi-agent manipulation problems. Experiments show that our method outperforms
> existing constrained motion planners and operates at speeds suitable for
> real-world applications. Video demonstrations are available at
