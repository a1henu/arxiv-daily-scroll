## 摘要（原文）

> Standardized alignment of the embryo in three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound
> images aids prenatal growth monitoring by facilitating standard plane
> detection, improving visualization of landmarks and accentuating differences
> between different scans. In this work, we propose an automated method for
> standardizing this alignment. Given a segmentation mask of the embryo,
> Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to the mask extracting the
> embryo's principal axes, from which four candidate orientations are derived.
> The candidate in standard orientation is selected using one of three
> strategies: a heuristic based on Pearson's correlation assessing shape, image
> matching to an atlas through normalized cross-correlation, and a Random Forest
> classifier. We tested our method on 2166 images longitudinally acquired 3D
> ultrasound scans from 1043 pregnancies from the Rotterdam Periconceptional
> Cohort, ranging from 7+0 to 12+6 weeks of gestational age. In 99.0% of images,
> PCA correctly extracted the principal axes of the embryo. The correct candidate
> was selected by the Pearson Heuristic, Atlas-based and Random Forest in 97.4%,
> 95.8%, and 98.4% of images, respectively. A Majority Vote of these selection
> methods resulted in an accuracy of 98.5%. The high accuracy of this pipeline
> enables consistent embryonic alignment in the first trimester, enabling
> scalable analysis in both clinical and research settings. The code is publicly
