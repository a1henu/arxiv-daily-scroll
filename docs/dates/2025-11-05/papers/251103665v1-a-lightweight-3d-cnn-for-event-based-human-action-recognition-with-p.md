## 摘要（原文）

> This paper presents a lightweight three-dimensional convolutional neural
> network (3DCNN) for human activity recognition (HAR) using event-based vision
> data. Privacy preservation is a key challenge in human monitoring systems, as
> conventional frame-based cameras capture identifiable personal information. In
> contrast, event cameras record only changes in pixel intensity, providing an
> inherently privacy-preserving sensing modality. The proposed network
> effectively models both spatial and temporal dynamics while maintaining a
> compact design suitable for edge deployment. To address class imbalance and
> enhance generalization, focal loss with class reweighting and targeted data
> augmentation strategies are employed. The model is trained and evaluated on a
> composite dataset derived from the Toyota Smart Home and ETRI datasets.
> Experimental results demonstrate an F1-score of 0.9415 and an overall accuracy
> of 94.17%, outperforming benchmark 3D-CNN architectures such as C3D, ResNet3D,
> and MC3_18 by up to 3%. These results highlight the potential of event-based
> deep learning for developing accurate, efficient, and privacy-aware human
> action recognition systems suitable for real-world edge applications.
