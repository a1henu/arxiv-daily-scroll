## 摘要（原文）

> Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter two key issues
> in multi-image contexts: (1) a lack of fine-grained perception across disparate
> images, and (2) a diminished capability to effectively reason over and
> synthesize information from multiple visual inputs. However, while various
> prompting methods aim to describe visual content, many existing studies focus
> primarily on single-image settings or specific, constrained scenarios. This
> leaves a critical gap in understanding and addressing how MLLMs tackle more
> general and complex multi-image reasoning tasks. Thus, we first extensively
> investigate how current prompting methods perceive fine-grained visual details
> and process visual information when dealing with multiple images. Our findings
> reveal that existing prompting methods fall short in attending to needed clues
> and seamlessly integrating perception and reasoning. Inspired by the findings,
> we propose a new zero-shot prompting method, Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions
> (QG-CoC), a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems
> with an arbitrary number of images. We evaluate our method on various
> open-source and closed-source MLLMs for multi-image and single-image
> benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that QG-CoC demonstrates competitive
> performance across tasks and exhibits robust improvements in the challenging
> scenarios where existing prompting methods fail.
