- 方法要点：采用叛逆学生范式，训练空间分支与光谱教师分支互补学习。
- 实验效果：在HAD100基准上显著提升检测性能，计算开销低。

## 摘要（原文）

> A recent class of hyperspectral anomaly detection methods that can be trained
> once on background datasets and then universally deployed -- without per-scene
> retraining or parameter tuning -- has demonstrated remarkable efficiency and
> robustness. Building upon this paradigm, we focus on the integration of
> spectral and spatial cues and introduce a novel "Rebellious Student" framework
> for complementary feature learning. Unlike conventional teacher-student
> paradigms driven by imitation, our method intentionally trains the spatial
> branch to diverge from the spectral teacher, thereby learning complementary
> spatial patterns that the teacher fails to capture. A two-stage learning
> strategy is adopted: (1) a spectral enhancement network is first trained via
> reverse distillation to obtain robust background spectral representations; and
> (2) a spatial network -- the rebellious student -- is subsequently optimized
> using decorrelation losses that enforce feature orthogonality while maintaining
> reconstruction fidelity to avoid irrelevant noise. Once trained, the framework
> enhances both spectral and spatial background features, enabling parameter-free
> and training-free anomaly detection when paired with conventional detectors.
> Extensive experiments on the HAD100 benchmark show substantial improvements
> over several established baselines with minimal computational overhead,
> confirming the effectiveness and generality of the proposed complementary
> learning paradigm. Our code is publicly available at
