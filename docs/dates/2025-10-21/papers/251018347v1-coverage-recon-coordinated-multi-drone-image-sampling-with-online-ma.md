## 摘要（原文）

> This article addresses collaborative 3D map reconstruction using multiple
> drones. Achieving high-quality reconstruction requires capturing images of
> keypoints within the target scene from diverse viewing angles, and coverage
> control offers an effective framework to meet this requirement. Meanwhile,
> recent advances in real-time 3D reconstruction algorithms make it possible to
> render an evolving map during flight, enabling immediate feedback to guide
> drone motion. Building on this, we present Coverage-Recon, a novel coordinated
> image sampling algorithm that integrates online map feedback to improve
> reconstruction quality on-the-fly. In Coverage-Recon, the coordinated motion of
> drones is governed by a Quadratic Programming (QP)-based angle-aware coverage
> controller, which ensures multi-viewpoint image capture while enforcing safety
> constraints. The captured images are processed in real time by the NeuralRecon
> algorithm to generate an evolving 3D mesh. Mesh changes across the scene are
> interpreted as indicators of reconstruction uncertainty and serve as feedback
> to update the importance index of the coverage control as the map evolves. The
> effectiveness of Coverage-Recon is validated through simulation and
> experiments, demonstrating both qualitatively and quantitatively that
> incorporating online map feedback yields more complete and accurate 3D
> reconstructions than conventional methods. Project page:
