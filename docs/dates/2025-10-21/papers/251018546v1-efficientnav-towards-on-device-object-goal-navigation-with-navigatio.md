## 摘要（原文）

> Object-goal navigation (ObjNav) tasks an agent with navigating to the
> location of a specific object in an unseen environment. Embodied agents
> equipped with large language models (LLMs) and online constructed navigation
> maps can perform ObjNav in a zero-shot manner. However, existing agents heavily
> rely on giant LLMs on the cloud, e.g., GPT-4, while directly switching to small
> LLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-11b, suffer from significant success rate drops due to
> limited model capacity for understanding complex navigation maps, which
> prevents deploying ObjNav on local devices. At the same time, the long prompt
> introduced by the navigation map description will cause high planning latency
> on local devices. In this paper, we propose EfficientNav to enable on-device
> efficient LLM-based zero-shot ObjNav. To help the smaller LLMs better
> understand the environment, we propose semantics-aware memory retrieval to
> prune redundant information in navigation maps. To reduce planning latency, we
> propose discrete memory caching and attention-based memory clustering to
> efficiently save and re-use the KV cache. Extensive experimental results
> demonstrate that EfficientNav achieves 11.1% improvement in success rate on
> HM3D benchmark over GPT-4-based baselines, and demonstrates 6.7x real-time
> latency reduction and 4.7x end-to-end latency reduction over GPT-4 planner. Our
> code will be released soon.
