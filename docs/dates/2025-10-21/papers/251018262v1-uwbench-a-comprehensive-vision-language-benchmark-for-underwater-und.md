## 摘要（原文）

> Large vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
> natural scene understanding, yet their application to underwater environments
> remains largely unexplored. Underwater imagery presents unique challenges
> including severe light attenuation, color distortion, and suspended particle
> scattering, while requiring specialized knowledge of marine ecosystems and
> organism taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we introduce UWBench, a comprehensive
> benchmark specifically designed for underwater vision-language understanding.
> UWBench comprises 15,003 high-resolution underwater images captured across
> diverse aquatic environments, encompassing oceans, coral reefs, and deep-sea
> habitats. Each image is enriched with human-verified annotations including
> 15,281 object referring expressions that precisely describe marine organisms
> and underwater structures, and 124,983 question-answer pairs covering diverse
> reasoning capabilities from object recognition to ecological relationship
> understanding. The dataset captures rich variations in visibility, lighting
> conditions, and water turbidity, providing a realistic testbed for model
> evaluation. Based on UWBench, we establish three comprehensive benchmarks:
> detailed image captioning for generating ecologically informed scene
> descriptions, visual grounding for precise localization of marine organisms,
> and visual question answering for multimodal reasoning about underwater
> environments. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs demonstrate that
> underwater understanding remains challenging, with substantial room for
> improvement. Our benchmark provides essential resources for advancing
> vision-language research in underwater contexts and supporting applications in
> marine science, ecological monitoring, and autonomous underwater exploration.
> Our code and benchmark will be available.
