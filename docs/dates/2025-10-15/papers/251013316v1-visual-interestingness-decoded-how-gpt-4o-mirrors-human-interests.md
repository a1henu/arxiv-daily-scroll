## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：视觉有趣性概念在大规模多模态模型中的捕捉程度及其与人类评估的对齐。
- 方法要点：通过比较分析评估GPT-4o与人类在视觉有趣性预测上的对齐。
- 实验或效果：GPT-4o在视觉有趣性评估中表现优于现有方法，支持图像对标注和知识蒸馏。

## 摘要（原文）

> Our daily life is highly influenced by what we consume and see. Attracting
> and holding one's attention -- the definition of (visual) interestingness -- is
> essential. The rise of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) trained on large-scale
> visual and textual data has demonstrated impressive capabilities. We explore
> these models' potential to understand to what extent the concepts of visual
> interestingness are captured and examine the alignment between human
> assessments and GPT-4o's, a leading LMM, predictions through comparative
> analysis. Our studies reveal partial alignment between humans and GPT-4o. It
> already captures the concept as best compared to state-of-the-art methods.
> Hence, this allows for the effective labeling of image pairs according to their
> (commonly) interestingness, which are used as training data to distill the
> knowledge into a learning-to-rank model. The insights pave the way for a deeper
> understanding of human interest.
