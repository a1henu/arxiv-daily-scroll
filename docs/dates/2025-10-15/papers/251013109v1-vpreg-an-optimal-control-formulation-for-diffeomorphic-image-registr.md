## 摘要（原文）

> This paper introduces VPreg, a novel diffeomorphic image registration method.
> This work provides several improvements to our past work on mesh generation and
> diffeomorphic image registration. VPreg aims to achieve excellent registration
> accuracy while controlling the quality of the registration transformations. It
> ensures a positive Jacobian determinant of the spatial transformation and
> provides an accurate approximation of the inverse of the registration, a
> crucial property for many neuroimaging workflows. Unlike conventional methods,
> VPreg generates this inverse transformation within the group of diffeomorphisms
> rather than operating on the image space. The core of VPreg is a grid
> generation approach, referred to as \emph{Variational Principle} (VP), which
> constructs non-folding grids with prescribed Jacobian determinant and curl.
> These VP-generated grids guarantee diffeomorphic spatial transformations
> essential for computational anatomy and morphometry, and provide a more
> accurate inverse than existing methods. To assess the potential of the proposed
> approach, we conduct a performance analysis for 150 registrations of brain
> scans from the OASIS-1 dataset. Performance evaluation based on Dice scores for
> 35 regions of interest, along with an empirical analysis of the properties of
> the computed spatial transformations, demonstrates that VPreg outperforms
> state-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice scores, regularity properties of the
> computed transformation, and accuracy and consistency of the provided inverse
> map. We compare our results to ANTs-SyN, Freesurfer-Easyreg, and FSL-Fnirt.
