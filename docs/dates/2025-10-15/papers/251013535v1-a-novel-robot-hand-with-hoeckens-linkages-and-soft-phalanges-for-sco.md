## 摘要（原文）

> This paper presents a novel underactuated adaptive robotic hand, Hockens-A
> Hand, which integrates the Hoeckens mechanism, a double-parallelogram linkage,
> and a specialized four-bar linkage to achieve three adaptive grasping modes:
> parallel pinching, asymmetric scooping, and enveloping grasping. Hockens-A Hand
> requires only a single linear actuator, leveraging passive mechanical
> intelligence to ensure adaptability and compliance in unstructured
> environments. Specifically, the vertical motion of the Hoeckens mechanism
> introduces compliance, the double-parallelogram linkage ensures line contact at
> the fingertip, and the four-bar amplification system enables natural
> transitions between different grasping modes. Additionally, the inclusion of a
> mesh-textured silicone phalanx further enhances the ability to envelop objects
> of various shapes and sizes. This study employs detailed kinematic analysis to
> optimize the push angle and design the linkage lengths for optimal performance.
> Simulations validated the design by analyzing the fingertip motion and ensuring
> smooth transitions between grasping modes. Furthermore, the grasping force was
> analyzed using power equations to enhance the understanding of the system's
> performance.Experimental validation using a 3D-printed prototype demonstrates
> the three grasping modes of the hand in various scenarios under environmental
> constraints, verifying its grasping stability and broad applicability.
