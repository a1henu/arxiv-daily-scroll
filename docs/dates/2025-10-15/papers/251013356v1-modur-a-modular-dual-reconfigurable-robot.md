## 摘要（原文）

> Modular Self-Reconfigurable Robot (MSRR) systems are a class of robots
> capable of forming higher-level robotic systems by altering the topological
> relationships between modules, offering enhanced adaptability and robustness in
> various environments. This paper presents a novel MSRR called MODUR, featuring
> dual-level reconfiguration capabilities designed to integrate reconfigurable
> mechanisms into MSRR. Specifically, MODUR can perform high-level
> self-reconfiguration among modules to create different configurations, while
> each module is also able to change its shape to execute basic motions. The
> design of MODUR primarily includes a compact connector and scissor linkage
> groups that provide actuation, forming a parallel mechanism capable of
> achieving both connector motion decoupling and adjacent position migration
> capabilities. Furthermore, the workspace, considering the interdependent
> connectors, is comprehensively analyzed, laying a theoretical foundation for
> the design of the module's basic motion. Finally, the motion of MODUR is
> validated through a series of experiments.
