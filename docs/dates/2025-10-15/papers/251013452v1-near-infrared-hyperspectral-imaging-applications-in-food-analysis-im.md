## 摘要（原文）

> This thesis investigates the application of near-infrared hyperspectral
> imaging (NIR-HSI) for food quality analysis. The investigation is conducted
> through four studies operating with five research hypotheses. For several
> analyses, the studies compare models based on convolutional neural networks
> (CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS). Generally, joint spatio-spectral
> analysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis
> with PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual
> information are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a
> 2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to
> performing spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning
> a spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still,
> PLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean
> content of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach.
> Modeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is
> limited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values.
> Therefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat
> content in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and
> pixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\%. Conversely, a 2D CNN
> augmented with a spectral convolution layer mitigated all issues arising with
> PLS. The final study attempted to model barley's germinative capacity by
> analyzing NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI images. However, the results
> were inconclusive due to the dataset's low degree of germination. Additionally,
> this thesis has led to the development of two open-sourced Python packages. The
> first facilitates fast PLS-based modeling, while the second facilitates very
> fast cross-validation of PLS and other classical machine learning models with a
> new algorithm.
