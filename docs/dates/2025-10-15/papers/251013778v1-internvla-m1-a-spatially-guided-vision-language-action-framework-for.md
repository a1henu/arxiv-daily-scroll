**一句话要点**：提出InternVLA-M1框架，通过空间引导训练提升通用机器人指令跟随能力

**关键词**：空间基础, 视觉语言动作, 机器人控制, 通用智能, 指令跟随

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：机器人难以将指令与视觉空间位置对齐，影响通用智能。
- 方法要点：采用两阶段训练，先空间预训练定位，后空间引导动作生成。
- 实验效果：在多个基准上性能提升显著，如SimperEnv提升14.6%。

## 摘要（原文）

> We introduce InternVLA-M1, a unified framework for spatial grounding and
> robot control that advances instruction-following robots toward scalable,
> general-purpose intelligence. Its core idea is spatially guided
> vision-language-action training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical
> link between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage
> pipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning
> data to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual,
> embodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training
> to decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through
> plug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields
> consistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance
> by +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO
> Franka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box,
> point, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built a
> simulation engine to collect 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes,
> enabling a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In
> real-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with
> synthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel
> configurations. Moreover, in long-horizon reasoning-intensive scenarios, it
> surpassed existing works by over 10%. These results highlight spatially guided
> training as a unifying principle for scalable and resilient generalist robots.
