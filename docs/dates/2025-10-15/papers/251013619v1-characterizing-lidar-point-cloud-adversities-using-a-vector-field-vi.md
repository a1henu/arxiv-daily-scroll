**一句话要点**：提出向量场可视化方法以辅助离线分析激光雷达点云配准中的逆境模式

**关键词**：激光雷达点云, 向量场可视化, 点云配准, 逆境模式分析, 离线分析

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：激光雷达点云配准中逆境模式难以从原始数据中提取和分类
- 方法要点：生成向量场图可视化配准点云间的局部差异，便于人工分析
- 实验或效果：在仿真和现场实验中，分析师能推理并迭代移除逆境机制，聚焦小差异

## 摘要（原文）

> In this paper we introduce a visualization methodology to aid a human analyst
> in classifying adversity modes that impact lidar scan matching. Our methodology
> is intended for offline rather than real-time analysis. The method generates a
> vector-field plot that characterizes local discrepancies between a pair of
> registered point clouds. The vector field plot reveals patterns that would be
> difficult for the analyst to extract from raw point-cloud data. After
> introducing our methodology, we apply the process to two proof-of-concept
> examples: one a simulation study and the other a field experiment. For both
> data sets, a human analyst was able to reason about a series of adversity
> mechanisms and iteratively remove those mechanisms from the raw data, to help
> focus attention on progressively smaller discrepancies.
