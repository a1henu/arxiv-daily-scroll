**arXiv**：[2510.13594v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13594) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13594.pdf)  
**作者**：Austin Barret, Meng Cheng Lau  

**一句话要点**：开发直观GUI以简化非专家对人形机器人的遥操作

**关键词**：人形机器人, 图形用户界面, 人机交互, 遥操作, 非专家操作

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：现有系统缺乏针对非专家的图形用户界面，操作复杂。
- 方法要点：结合UI开发和HRI概念，设计可扩展的直观GUI。
- 实验或效果：用于非专家在FIRA规范障碍课程中控制机器人。

## 摘要（原文）

> The operation of humanoid robotics is an essential field of research with
> many practical and competitive applications. Many of these systems, however, do
> not invest heavily in developing a non-expert-centered graphical user interface
> (GUI) for operation. The focus of this research is to develop a scalable GUI
> that is tailored to be simple and intuitive so non-expert operators can control
> the robot through a FIRA-regulated obstacle course. Using common practices from
> user interface development (UI) and understanding concepts described in
> human-robot interaction (HRI) and other related concepts, we will develop a new
> interface with the goal of a non-expert teleoperation system.
