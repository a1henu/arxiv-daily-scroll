## 摘要（原文）

> Collaborative perception has been proven to improve individual perception in
> autonomous driving through multi-agent interaction. Nevertheless, most methods
> often assume identical encoders for all agents, which does not hold true when
> these models are deployed in real-world applications. To realize collaborative
> perception in actual heterogeneous scenarios, existing methods usually align
> neighbor features to those of the ego vehicle, which is vulnerable to noise
> from domain gaps and thus fails to address feature discrepancies effectively.
> Moreover, they adopt transformer-based modules for domain adaptation, which
> causes the model inference inefficiency on mobile devices. To tackle these
> issues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages
> Domain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios.
> The CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight
> Spatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation
> (DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI)
> loss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the
> neighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight
> convolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution
> discrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation
> modules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter
> captures task-related information. During training, the DAMI loss maximizes the
> mutual information between aligned heterogeneous features to enhance the domain
> separation process. The CoDS employs a fully convolutional architecture, which
> ensures high inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
> CoDS effectively mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios and
> achieves a trade-off between detection accuracy and inference efficiency.
