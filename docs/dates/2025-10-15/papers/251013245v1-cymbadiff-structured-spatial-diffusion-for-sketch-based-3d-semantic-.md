- 方法要点：CymbaDiff引入结构化空间排序，捕捉圆柱连续性和垂直层次。
- 实验或效果：在SketchSem3D基准上实现优越语义一致性和空间真实性。

## 摘要（原文）

> Outdoor 3D semantic scene generation produces realistic and semantically rich
> environments for applications such as urban simulation and autonomous driving.
> However, advances in this direction are constrained by the absence of publicly
> available, well-annotated datasets. We introduce SketchSem3D, the first
> large-scale benchmark for generating 3D outdoor semantic scenes from abstract
> freehand sketches and pseudo-labeled annotations of satellite images.
> SketchSem3D includes two subsets, Sketch-based SemanticKITTI and Sketch-based
> KITTI-360 (containing LiDAR voxels along with their corresponding sketches and
> annotated satellite images), to enable standardized, rigorous, and diverse
> evaluations. We also propose Cylinder Mamba Diffusion (CymbaDiff) that
> significantly enhances spatial coherence in outdoor 3D scene generation.
> CymbaDiff imposes structured spatial ordering, explicitly captures cylindrical
> continuity and vertical hierarchy, and preserves both physical neighborhood
> relationships and global context within the generated scenes. Extensive
> experiments on SketchSem3D demonstrate that CymbaDiff achieves superior
> semantic consistency, spatial realism, and cross-dataset generalization. The
> code and dataset will be available at
