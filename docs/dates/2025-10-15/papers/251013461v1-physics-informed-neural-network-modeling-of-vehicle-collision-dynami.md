## 摘要（原文）

> Accurate prediction of vehicle collision dynamics is crucial for advanced
> safety systems and post-impact control applications, yet existing methods face
> inherent trade-offs among computational efficiency, prediction accuracy, and
> data requirements. This paper proposes a dual Physics-Informed Neural Network
> framework addressing these challenges through two complementary networks. The
> first network integrates Gaussian Mixture Models with PINN architecture to
> learn impact force distributions from finite element analysis data while
> enforcing momentum conservation and energy consistency constraints. The second
> network employs an adaptive PINN with dynamic constraint weighting to predict
> post-collision vehicle dynamics, featuring an adaptive physics guard layer that
> prevents unrealistic predictions whil e preserving data-driven learning
> capabilities. The framework incorporates uncertainty quantification through
> time-varying parameters and enables rapid adaptation via fine-tuning
> strategies. Validation demonstrates significant improvements: the impact force
> model achieves relative errors below 15.0% for force prediction on finite
> element analysis (FEA) datasets, while the vehicle dynamics model reduces
> average trajectory prediction error by 63.6% compared to traditional
> four-degree-of-freedom models in scaled vehicle experiments. The integrated
> system maintains millisecond-level computational efficiency suitable for
> real-time applications while providing probabilistic confidence bounds
> essential for safety-critical control. Comprehensive validation through FEA
> simulation, dynamic modeling, and scaled vehicle experiments confirms the
> framework's effectiveness for Precision Immobilization Technique scenarios and
> general collision dynamics prediction.
