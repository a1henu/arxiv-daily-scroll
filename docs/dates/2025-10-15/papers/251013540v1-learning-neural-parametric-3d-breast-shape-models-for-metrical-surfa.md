## 摘要（原文）

> We present a neural parametric 3D breast shape model and, based on this
> model, introduce a low-cost and accessible 3D surface reconstruction pipeline
> capable of recovering accurate breast geometry from a monocular RGB video. In
> contrast to widely used, commercially available yet prohibitively expensive 3D
> breast scanning solutions and existing low-cost alternatives, our method
> requires neither specialized hardware nor proprietary software and can be used
> with any device that is able to record RGB videos. The key building blocks of
> our pipeline are a state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf Structure-from-motion
> pipeline, paired with a parametric breast model for robust and metrically
> correct surface reconstruction. Our model, similarly to the recently proposed
> implicit Regensburg Breast Shape Model (iRBSM), leverages implicit neural
> representations to model breast shapes. However, unlike the iRBSM, which
> employs a single global neural signed distance function (SDF), our approach --
> inspired by recent state-of-the-art face models -- decomposes the implicit
> breast domain into multiple smaller regions, each represented by a local neural
> SDF anchored at anatomical landmark positions. When incorporated into our
> surface reconstruction pipeline, the proposed model, dubbed liRBSM (short for
> localized iRBSM), significantly outperforms the iRBSM in terms of
> reconstruction quality, yielding more detailed surface reconstruction than its
> global counterpart. Overall, we find that the introduced pipeline is able to
> recover high-quality 3D breast geometry within an error margin of less than 2
> mm. Our method is fast (requires less than six minutes), fully transparent and
> open-source, and -- together with the model -- publicly available at
> https://rbsm.re-mic.de/local-implicit.
