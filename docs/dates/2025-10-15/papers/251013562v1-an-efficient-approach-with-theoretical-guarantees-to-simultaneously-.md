## 摘要（原文）

> In positron emission tomography (PET), it is indispensable to perform
> attenuation correction in order to obtain the quantitatively accurate activity
> map (tracer distribution) in the body. Generally, this is carried out based on
> the estimated attenuation map obtained from computed tomography or magnetic
> resonance imaging. However, except for errors in the attenuation correction
> factors obtained, the additional scan not only brings in new radiation doses
> and/or increases the scanning time but also leads to severe misalignment
> induced by various motions during and between the two sequential scans. To
> address these issues, based on maximum likelihood estimation, we propose a new
> mathematical model for simultaneously reconstructing the activity and
> attenuation sinogram from the time-of-flight (TOF)-PET emission data only.
> Particularly, we make full use of the exclusively exponential form for the
> attenuation correction factors, and consider the constraint of a total amount
> of the activity in some mask region in the proposed model. Furthermore, we
> prove its well-posedness, including the existence, uniqueness and stability of
> the solution. We propose an alternating update algorithm to solve the model,
> and also analyze its convergence. Finally, numerical experiments with various
> TOF-PET emission data demonstrate that the proposed method is of numerical
> convergence and robust to noise, and outperforms some state-of-the-art methods
> in terms of accuracy and efficiency, and has the capability of autonomous
> attenuation correction.
