**关键词**：四足机器人运动, 强化学习训练, 垂直地面扰动, 零样本迁移, 步态策略

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：四足机器人在垂直地面扰动（如振荡表面）下的运动性能未充分探索。
- 方法要点：使用PPO强化学习在MuJoCo模拟中训练多种步态策略，结合域随机化实现零样本迁移。
- 实验或效果：振荡桥训练策略在真实世界中表现出更高的稳定性和适应性。

## 摘要（原文）

> Legged robots, particularly quadrupeds, excel at navigating rough terrains,
> yet their performance under vertical ground perturbations, such as those from
> oscillating surfaces, remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel
> approach to enhance quadruped locomotion robustness by training the Unitree Go2
> robot on an oscillating bridge - a 13.24-meter steel-and-concrete structure
> with a 2.0 Hz eigenfrequency designed to perturb locomotion. Using
> Reinforcement Learning (RL) with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
> algorithm in a MuJoCo simulation, we trained 15 distinct locomotion policies,
> combining five gaits (trot, pace, bound, free, default) with three training
> conditions: rigid bridge and two oscillating bridge setups with differing
> height regulation strategies (relative to bridge surface or ground). Domain
> randomization ensured zero-shot transfer to the real-world bridge. Our results
> demonstrate that policies trained on the oscillating bridge exhibit superior
> stability and adaptability compared to those trained on rigid surfaces. Our
> framework enables robust gait patterns even without prior bridge exposure.
> These findings highlight the potential of simulation-based RL to improve
> quadruped locomotion during dynamic ground perturbations, offering insights for
> designing robots capable of traversing vibrating environments.
