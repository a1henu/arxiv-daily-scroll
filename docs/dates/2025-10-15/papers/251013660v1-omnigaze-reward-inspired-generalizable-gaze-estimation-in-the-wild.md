**一句话要点**：提出OmniGaze半监督框架，利用未标记数据提升3D视线估计的跨域泛化能力

**关键词**：3D视线估计, 半监督学习, 伪标签策略, 奖励模型, 跨域泛化, 零样本学习

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：3D视线估计方法因标注数据稀缺和多样性不足，难以泛化到不同数据域
- 方法要点：采用伪标签策略，结合奖励模型评估伪标签可靠性，融合视觉嵌入和语义线索
- 实验或效果：在五个数据集上实现SOTA性能，并在四个未见数据集上展示零样本泛化能力

## 摘要（原文）

> Current 3D gaze estimation methods struggle to generalize across diverse data
> domains, primarily due to i) the scarcity of annotated datasets, and ii) the
> insufficient diversity of labeled data. In this work, we present OmniGaze, a
> semi-supervised framework for 3D gaze estimation, which utilizes large-scale
> unlabeled data collected from diverse and unconstrained real-world environments
> to mitigate domain bias and generalize gaze estimation in the wild. First, we
> build a diverse collection of unlabeled facial images, varying in facial
> appearances, background environments, illumination conditions, head poses, and
> eye occlusions. In order to leverage unlabeled data spanning a broader
> distribution, OmniGaze adopts a standard pseudo-labeling strategy and devises a
> reward model to assess the reliability of pseudo labels. Beyond pseudo labels
> as 3D direction vectors, the reward model also incorporates visual embeddings
> extracted by an off-the-shelf visual encoder and semantic cues from gaze
> perspective generated by prompting a Multimodal Large Language Model to compute
> confidence scores. Then, these scores are utilized to select high-quality
> pseudo labels and weight them for loss computation. Extensive experiments
> demonstrate that OmniGaze achieves state-of-the-art performance on five
> datasets under both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Furthermore, we also
> evaluate the efficacy of OmniGaze as a scalable data engine for gaze
> estimation, which exhibits robust zero-shot generalization on four unseen
> datasets.
