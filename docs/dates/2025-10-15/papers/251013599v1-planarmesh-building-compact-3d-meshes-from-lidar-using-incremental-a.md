## 摘要（原文）

> Building an online 3D LiDAR mapping system that produces a detailed surface
> reconstruction while remaining computationally efficient is a challenging task.
> In this paper, we present PlanarMesh, a novel incremental, mesh-based LiDAR
> reconstruction system that adaptively adjusts mesh resolution to achieve
> compact, detailed reconstructions in real-time. It introduces a new
> representation, planar-mesh, which combines plane modeling and meshing to
> capture both large surfaces and detailed geometry. The planar-mesh can be
> incrementally updated considering both local surface curvature and free-space
> information from sensor measurements. We employ a multi-threaded architecture
> with a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) for efficient data storage and fast
> search operations, enabling real-time performance. Experimental results show
> that our method achieves reconstruction accuracy on par with, or exceeding,
> state-of-the-art techniques-including truncated signed distance functions,
> occupancy mapping, and voxel-based meshing-while producing smaller output file
> sizes (10 times smaller than raw input and more than 5 times smaller than
> mesh-based methods) and maintaining real-time performance (around 2 Hz for a
> 64-beam sensor).
