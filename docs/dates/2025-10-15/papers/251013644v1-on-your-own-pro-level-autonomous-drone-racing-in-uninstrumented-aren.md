**一句话要点**：提出自主无人机竞速系统，在无外部追踪环境中匹配专业飞行员性能

**关键词**：自主无人机竞速, 视觉自主导航, 无外部追踪环境, 性能评估, 数据发布

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：现有自主系统依赖受控环境，难以直接应用于真实世界。
- 方法要点：结合视觉自主技术，在无外部追踪环境中实现竞速。
- 实验或效果：在受控和无追踪环境中均达到专业人类飞行员水平。

## 摘要（原文）

> Drone technology is proliferating in many industries, including agriculture,
> logistics, defense, infrastructure, and environmental monitoring. Vision-based
> autonomy is one of its key enablers, particularly for real-world applications.
> This is essential for operating in novel, unstructured environments where
> traditional navigation methods may be unavailable. Autonomous drone racing has
> become the de facto benchmark for such systems. State-of-the-art research has
> shown that autonomous systems can surpass human-level performance in racing
> arenas. However, direct applicability to commercial and field operations is
> still limited as current systems are often trained and evaluated in highly
> controlled environments. In our contribution, the system's capabilities are
> analyzed within a controlled environment -- where external tracking is
> available for ground-truth comparison -- but also demonstrated in a
> challenging, uninstrumented environment -- where ground-truth measurements were
> never available. We show that our approach can match the performance of
> professional human pilots in both scenarios. We also publicly release the data
> from the flights carried out by our approach and a world-class human pilot.
