**关键词**：双臂机器人, 遥操作, 6自由度臂, RGB数据收集, 人体工学设计, 厨房场景

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：原ALOHA机器人在性能和鲁棒性方面存在不足，需改进以适应复杂任务。
- 方法要点：采用双ViperX 6自由度臂和WidowX臂，通过背驱控制实现精确遥操作。
- 实验或效果：集成多视角摄像头收集RGB数据，支持厨房应用场景的复现与测试。

## 摘要（原文）

> ALOHA2 is an enhanced version of the dual-arm teleoperated robot ALOHA,
> featuring higher performance and robustness compared to the original design,
> while also being more ergonomic. Like ALOHA, ALOHA2 consists of two grippers
> and two ViperX 6-DoF arms, as well as two smaller WidowX arms. Users control
> the follower mechanical arms by operating the leader mechanical arms through
> back-driving. The device also includes cameras that generate images from
> multiple viewpoints, allowing for RGB data collection during teleoperation. The
> robot is mounted on a 48-inch x 30-inch table, equipped with an aluminum frame
> that provides additional mounting points for cameras and gravity compensation
> systems.
