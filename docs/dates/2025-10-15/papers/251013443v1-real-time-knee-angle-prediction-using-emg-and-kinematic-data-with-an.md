## 摘要（原文）

> Electromyography (EMG) signals are widely used for predicting body joint
> angles through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods. However,
> these approaches often face challenges such as limited real-time applicability,
> non-representative test conditions, and the need for large datasets to achieve
> optimal performance. This paper presents a transfer-learning framework for knee
> joint angle prediction that requires only a few gait cycles from new subjects.
> Three datasets - Georgia Tech, the University of California Irvine (UCI), and
> the Sharif Mechatronic Lab Exoskeleton (SMLE) - containing four EMG channels
> relevant to knee motion were utilized. A lightweight attention-based CNN-LSTM
> model was developed and pre-trained on the Georgia Tech dataset, then
> transferred to the UCI and SMLE datasets. The proposed model achieved
> Normalized Mean Absolute Errors (NMAE) of 6.8 percent and 13.7 percent for
> one-step and 50-step predictions on abnormal subjects using EMG inputs alone.
> Incorporating historical knee angles reduced the NMAE to 3.1 percent and 3.5
> percent for normal subjects, and to 2.8 percent and 7.5 percent for abnormal
> subjects. When further adapted to the SMLE exoskeleton with EMG, kinematic, and
> interaction force inputs, the model achieved 1.09 percent and 3.1 percent NMAE
> for one- and 50-step predictions, respectively. These results demonstrate
> robust performance and strong generalization for both short- and long-term
> rehabilitation scenarios.
