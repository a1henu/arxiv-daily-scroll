## 摘要（原文）

> This study investigates the performance of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks
> (3D CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for real-time American
> Sign Language (ASL) recognition. Though 3D CNNs are good at spatiotemporal
> feature extraction from video sequences, LSTMs are optimized for modeling
> temporal dependencies in sequential data. We evaluate both architectures on a
> dataset containing 1,200 ASL signs across 50 classes, comparing their accuracy,
> computational efficiency, and latency under similar training conditions.
> Experimental results demonstrate that 3D CNNs achieve 92.4% recognition
> accuracy but require 3.2% more processing time per frame compared to LSTMs,
> which maintain 86.7% accuracy with significantly lower resource consumption.
> The hybrid 3D CNNLSTM model shows decent performance, which suggests that
> context-dependent architecture selection is crucial for practical
> implementation.This project provides professional benchmarks for developing
> assistive technologies, highlighting trade-offs between recognition precision
> and real-time operational requirements in edge computing environments.
