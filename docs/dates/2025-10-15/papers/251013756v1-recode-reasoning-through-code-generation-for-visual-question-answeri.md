# RECODE: Reasoning Through Code Generation for Visual Question Answering
**arXiv**：[2510.13756v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13756) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13756.pdf)

**一句话要点**：提出RECODE框架，通过代码生成解决多模态大模型在图表推理中的验证问题

**关键词**：视觉问答, 代码生成, 反渲染, 多模态推理, 可验证推理, 结构化视觉

## 3 点简述
- 多模态大模型在图表等结构化视觉推理中缺乏验证机制，导致精确推理困难
- RECODE框架通过反渲染生成候选代码，并迭代优化以选择最忠实重构
- 在CharXiv等基准上，RECODE显著优于不利用代码或仅用于辅助的方法

## 摘要（原文）

> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with precise reasoning for
> structured visuals like charts and diagrams, as pixel-based perception lacks a
> mechanism for verification. To address this, we propose to leverage derendering
> -- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new
> modality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an
> agentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce
> the input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful
> reconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only
> transforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem,
> but also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On
> various visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K,
> RECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use
> code for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that
> grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more
> accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning.
