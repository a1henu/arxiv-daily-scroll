## 摘要（原文）

> We introduce iFlyBot-VLM, a general-purpose Vision-Language Model (VLM) used
> to improve the domain of Embodied Intelligence. The central objective of
> iFlyBot-VLM is to bridge the cross-modal semantic gap between high-dimensional
> environmental perception and low-level robotic motion control. To this end, the
> model abstracts complex visual and spatial information into a body-agnostic and
> transferable Operational Language, thereby enabling seamless perception-action
> closed-loop coordination across diverse robotic platforms. The architecture of
> iFlyBot-VLM is systematically designed to realize four key functional
> capabilities essential for embodied intelligence: 1) Spatial Understanding and
> Metric Reasoning; 2) Interactive Target Grounding; 3) Action Abstraction and
> Control Parameter Generation; 4) Task Planning and Skill Sequencing. We
> envision iFlyBot-VLM as a scalable and generalizable foundation model for
> embodied AI, facilitating the progression from specialized task-oriented
> systems toward generalist, cognitively capable agents. We conducted evaluations
> on 10 current mainstream embodied intelligence-related VLM benchmark datasets,
> such as Blink and Where2Place, and achieved optimal performance while
> preserving the model's general capabilities. We will publicly release both the
> training data and model weights to foster further research and development in
> the field of Embodied Intelligence.
