## 摘要（原文）

> Soft robot manipulators have the potential for deployment in delicate
> environments to perform complex manipulation tasks. However, existing obstacle
> detection and avoidance methods do not consider limits on the forces that
> manipulators may exert upon contact with delicate obstacles. This work
> introduces a framework that maps force safety criteria from task space (i.e.
> positions along the robot's body) to configuration space (i.e. the robot's
> joint angles) and enables real-time force safety detection. We incorporate
> limits on allowable environmental contact forces for given task-space
> obstacles, and map them into configuration space (C-space) through the
> manipulator's forward kinematics. This formulation ensures that configurations
> classified as safe are provably below the maximum force thresholds, thereby
> allowing us to determine force-safe configurations of the soft robot
> manipulator in real-time. We validate our approach in simulation and hardware
> experiments on a two-segment pneumatic soft robot manipulator. Results
> demonstrate that the proposed method accurately detects force safety during
> interactions with deformable obstacles, thereby laying the foundation for
> real-time safe planning of soft manipulators in delicate, cluttered
> environments.
