## 摘要（原文）

> Robust loop closure detection is a critical component of Simultaneous
> Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms in GNSS-denied environments, such as
> in the context of planetary exploration. In these settings, visual place
> recognition often fails due to aliasing and weak textures, while LiDAR-based
> methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity. This paper presents MPRF, a
> multimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both
> vision and LiDAR modalities to achieve robust loop closure in severely
> unstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF
> integrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose
> estimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient
> candidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric
> verification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show
> that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while
> enhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions. By providing
> interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, MPRF achieves a
> favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability,
> demonstrating the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and
> pose estimation. Code and models will be released at github.com/DLR-RM/MPRF.
