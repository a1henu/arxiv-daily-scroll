## 摘要（原文）

> Image restoration (IR) aims to recover clean images from degraded
> observations. Despite remarkable progress, most existing methods focus on a
> single degradation type, whereas real-world images often suffer from multiple
> coexisting degradations, such as rain, noise, and haze coexisting in a single
> image, which limits their practical effectiveness. In this paper, we propose an
> adaptive multi-degradation image restoration network that reconstructs images
> by leveraging decoupled representations of degradation ingredients to guide
> path selection. Specifically, we design a degradation ingredient decoupling
> block (DIDBlock) in the encoder to separate degradation ingredients
> statistically by integrating spatial and frequency domain information,
> enhancing the recognition of multiple degradation types and making their
> feature representations independent. In addition, we present fusion block
> (FBlock) to integrate degradation information across all levels using learnable
> matrices. In the decoder, we further introduce a task adaptation block
> (TABlock) that dynamically activates or fuses functional branches based on the
> multi-degradation representation, flexibly selecting optimal restoration paths
> under diverse degradation conditions. The resulting tightly integrated
> architecture, termed IMDNet, is extensively validated through experiments,
> showing superior performance on multi-degradation restoration while maintaining
> strong competitiveness on single-degradation tasks.
