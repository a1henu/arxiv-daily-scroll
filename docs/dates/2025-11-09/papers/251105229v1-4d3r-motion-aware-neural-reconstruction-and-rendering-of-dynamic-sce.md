## 摘要（原文）

> Novel view synthesis from monocular videos of dynamic scenes with unknown
> camera poses remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics.
> While recent advances in 3D representations such as Neural Radiance Fields
> (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown promising results for static
> scenes, they struggle with dynamic content and typically rely on pre-computed
> camera poses. We present 4D3R, a pose-free dynamic neural rendering framework
> that decouples static and dynamic components through a two-stage approach. Our
> method first leverages 3D foundational models for initial pose and geometry
> estimation, followed by motion-aware refinement. 4D3R introduces two key
> technical innovations: (1) a motion-aware bundle adjustment (MA-BA) module that
> combines transformer-based learned priors with SAM2 for robust dynamic object
> segmentation, enabling more accurate camera pose refinement; and (2) an
> efficient Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting (MA-GS) representation that uses
> control points with a deformation field MLP and linear blend skinning to model
> dynamic motion, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining
> high-quality reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic
> datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 1.8dB PSNR improvement
> over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with large
> dynamic objects, while reducing computational requirements by 5x compared to
> previous dynamic scene representations.
