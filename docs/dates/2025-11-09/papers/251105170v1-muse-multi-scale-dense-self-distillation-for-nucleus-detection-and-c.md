## 摘要（原文）

> Nucleus detection and classification (NDC) in histopathology analysis is a
> fundamental task that underpins a wide range of high-level pathology
> applications. However, existing methods heavily rely on labor-intensive
> nucleus-level annotations and struggle to fully exploit large-scale unlabeled
> data for learning discriminative nucleus representations. In this work, we
> propose MUSE (MUlti-scale denSE self-distillation), a novel self-supervised
> learning method tailored for NDC. At its core is NuLo (Nucleus-based Local
> self-distillation), a coordinate-guided mechanism that enables flexible local
> self-distillation based on predicted nucleus positions. By removing the need
> for strict spatial alignment between augmented views, NuLo allows critical
> cross-scale alignment, thus unlocking the capacity of models for fine-grained
> nucleus-level representation. To support MUSE, we design a simple yet effective
> encoder-decoder architecture and a large field-of-view semi-supervised
> fine-tuning strategy that together maximize the value of unlabeled pathology
> images. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks demonstrate that
> MUSE effectively addresses the core challenges of histopathological NDC. The
> resulting models not only surpass state-of-the-art supervised baselines but
> also outperform generic pathology foundation models.
