**关键词**：全切片图像表示, 动态残差编码, 切片级对比学习, 记忆库, 癌症亚型分类, 突变预测

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：全切片图像包含数万图块，GPU限制下难以在单个小批次中计算所有图块梯度。
- 方法要点：使用记忆库存储图块特征，结合采样与检索特征进行残差编码生成表示。
- 实验或效果：在癌症亚型分类、识别和突变预测任务中验证了方法的有效性。

## 摘要（原文）

> Whole Slide Image (WSI) representation is critical for cancer subtyping,
> cancer recognition and mutation prediction.Training an end-to-end WSI
> representation model poses significant challenges, as a standard gigapixel
> slide can contain tens of thousands of image tiles, making it difficult to
> compute gradients of all tiles in a single mini-batch due to current GPU
> limitations. To address this challenge, we propose a method of dynamic residual
> encoding with slide-level contrastive learning (DRE-SLCL) for end-to-end WSI
> representation. Our approach utilizes a memory bank to store the features of
> tiles across all WSIs in the dataset. During training, a mini-batch usually
> contains multiple WSIs. For each WSI in the batch, a subset of tiles is
> randomly sampled and their features are computed using a tile encoder. Then,
> additional tile features from the same WSI are selected from the memory bank.
> The representation of each individual WSI is generated using a residual
> encoding technique that incorporates both the sampled features and those
> retrieved from the memory bank. Finally, the slide-level contrastive loss is
> computed based on the representations and histopathology reports ofthe WSIs
> within the mini-batch. Experiments conducted over cancer subtyping, cancer
> recognition, and mutation prediction tasks proved the effectiveness of the
> proposed DRE-SLCL method.
