## 摘要（原文）

> Continual learning is an emerging topic in the field of deep learning, where
> a model is expected to learn continuously for new upcoming tasks without
> forgetting previous experiences. This field has witnessed numerous
> advancements, but few works have been attempted in the direction of image
> restoration. Handling large image sizes and the divergent nature of various
> degradation poses a unique challenge in the restoration domain. However,
> existing works require heavily engineered architectural modifications for new
> task adaptation, resulting in significant computational overhead.
> Regularization-based methods are unsuitable for restoration, as different
> restoration challenges require different kinds of feature processing. In this
> direction, we propose a simple modification of the convolution layer to adapt
> the knowledge from previous restoration tasks without touching the main
> backbone architecture. Therefore, it can be seamlessly applied to any deep
> architecture without any structural modifications. Unlike other approaches, we
> demonstrate that our model can increase the number of trainable parameters
> without significantly increasing computational overhead or inference time.
> Experimental validation demonstrates that new restoration tasks can be
> introduced without compromising the performance of existing tasks. We also show
> that performance on new restoration tasks improves by adapting the knowledge
> from the knowledge base created by previous restoration tasks. The code is
> available at https://github.com/aupendu/continual-restore.
