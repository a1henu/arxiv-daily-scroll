## 摘要（原文）

> Simulating object deformations is a critical challenge across many scientific
> domains, including robotics, manufacturing, and structural mechanics. Learned
> Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer a promising alternative to traditional
> mesh-based physics simulators. Their speed and inherent differentiability make
> them particularly well suited for applications that require fast and accurate
> simulations, such as robotic manipulation or manufacturing optimization.
> However, existing learned simulators typically rely on single-step
> observations, which limits their ability to exploit temporal context. Without
> this information, these models fail to infer, e.g., material properties.
> Further, they rely on auto-regressive rollouts, which quickly accumulate error
> for long trajectories. We instead frame mesh-based simulation as a
> trajectory-level meta-learning problem. Using Conditional Neural Processes, our
> method enables rapid adaptation to new simulation scenarios from limited
> initial data while capturing their latent simulation properties. We utilize
> movement primitives to directly predict fast, stable and accurate simulations
> from a single model call. The resulting approach, Movement-primitive
> Meta-MeshGraphNet (M3GN), provides higher simulation accuracy at a fraction of
> the runtime cost compared to state-of-the-art GNSs across several tasks.
