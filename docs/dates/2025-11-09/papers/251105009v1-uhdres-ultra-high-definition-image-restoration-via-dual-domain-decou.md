## 摘要（原文）

> Ultra-high-definition (UHD) images often suffer from severe degradations such
> as blur, haze, rain, or low-light conditions, which pose significant challenges
> for image restoration due to their high resolution and computational demands.
> In this paper, we propose UHDRes, a novel lightweight dual-domain decoupled
> spectral modulation framework for UHD image restoration. It explicitly models
> the amplitude spectrum via lightweight spectrum-domain modulation, while
> restoring phase implicitly through spatial-domain refinement. We introduce the
> spatio-spectral fusion mechanism, which first employs a multi-scale context
> aggregator to extract local and global spatial features, and then performs
> spectral modulation in a decoupled manner. It explicitly enhances amplitude
> features in the frequency domain while implicitly restoring phase information
> through spatial refinement. Additionally, a shared gated feed-forward network
> is designed to efficiently promote feature interaction through shared-parameter
> convolutions and adaptive gating mechanisms. Extensive experimental comparisons
> on five public UHD benchmarks demonstrate that our UHDRes achieves the
> state-of-the-art restoration performance with only 400K parameters, while
> significantly reducing inference latency and memory usage. The codes and models
> are available at https://github.com/Zhao0100/UHDRes.
