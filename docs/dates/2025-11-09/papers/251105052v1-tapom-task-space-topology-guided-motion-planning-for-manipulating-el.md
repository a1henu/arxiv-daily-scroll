## 摘要（原文）

> Robotic manipulation in complex, constrained spaces is vital for widespread
> applications but challenging, particularly when navigating narrow passages with
> elongated objects. Existing planning methods often fail in these low-clearance
> scenarios due to the sampling difficulties or the local minima. This work
> proposes Topology-Aware Planning for Object Manipulation (TAPOM), which
> explicitly incorporates task-space topological analysis to enable efficient
> planning. TAPOM uses a high-level analysis to identify critical pathways and
> generate guiding keyframes, which are utilized in a low-level planner to find
> feasible configuration space trajectories. Experimental validation demonstrates
> significantly high success rates and improved efficiency over state-of-the-art
> methods on low-clearance manipulation tasks. This approach offers broad
> implications for enhancing manipulation capabilities of robots in complex
> real-world environments.
