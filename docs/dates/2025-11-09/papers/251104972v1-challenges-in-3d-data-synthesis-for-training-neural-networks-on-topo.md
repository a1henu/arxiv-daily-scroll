## 摘要（原文）

> Topological Data Analysis (TDA) involves techniques of analyzing the
> underlying structure and connectivity of data. However, traditional methods
> like persistent homology can be computationally demanding, motivating the
> development of neural network-based estimators capable of reducing
> computational overhead and inference time. A key barrier to advancing these
> methods is the lack of labeled 3D data with class distributions and diversity
> tailored specifically for supervised learning in TDA tasks. To address this, we
> introduce a novel approach for systematically generating labeled 3D datasets
> using the Repulsive Surface algorithm, allowing control over topological
> invariants, such as hole count. The resulting dataset offers varied geometry
> with topological labeling, making it suitable for training and benchmarking
> neural network estimators. This paper uses a synthetic 3D dataset to train a
> genus estimator network, created using a 3D convolutional transformer
> architecture. An observed decrease in accuracy as deformations increase
> highlights the role of not just topological complexity, but also geometric
> complexity, when training generalized estimators. This dataset fills a gap in
> labeled 3D datasets and generation for training and evaluating models and
> techniques for TDA.
