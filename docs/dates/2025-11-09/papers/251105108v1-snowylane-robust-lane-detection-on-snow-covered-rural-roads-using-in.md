## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：雪天车道标记常被遮挡或缺失，导致传统车道检测失效。
- 方法要点：检测路边柱状物作为间接车道指示，使用贝塞尔曲线拟合车道轨迹。
- 实验或效果：在合成数据集上验证，雪天鲁棒性优于现有方法。

## 摘要（原文）

> Lane detection for autonomous driving in snow-covered environments remains a
> major challenge due to the frequent absence or occlusion of lane markings. In
> this paper, we present a novel, robust and realtime capable approach that
> bypasses the reliance on traditional lane markings by detecting roadside
> features,specifically vertical roadside posts called delineators, as indirect
> lane indicators. Our method first perceives these posts, then fits a smooth
> lane trajectory using a parameterized Bezier curve model, leveraging spatial
> consistency and road geometry. To support training and evaluation in these
> challenging scenarios, we introduce SnowyLane, a new synthetic dataset
> containing 80,000 annotated frames capture winter driving conditions, with
> varying snow coverage, and lighting conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art
> lane detection systems, our approach demonstrates significantly improved
> robustness in adverse weather, particularly in cases with heavy snow occlusion.
> This work establishes a strong foundation for reliable lane detection in winter
> scenarios and contributes a valuable resource for future research in
> all-weather autonomous driving. The dataset is available at
