## 摘要（原文）

> Task-oriented dexterous grasping holds broad application prospects in robotic manipulation and human-object interaction. However, most existing methods still struggle to generalize across diverse objects and task instructions, as they heavily rely on costly labeled data to ensure task-specific semantic alignment. In this study, we propose \textbf{ZeroDexGrasp}, a zero-shot task-oriented dexterous grasp synthesis framework integrating Multimodal Large Language Models with grasp refinement to generate human-like grasp poses that are well aligned with specific task objectives and object affordances. Specifically, ZeroDexGrasp employs prompt-based multi-stage semantic reasoning to infer initial grasp configurations and object contact information from task and object semantics, then exploits contact-guided grasp optimization to refine these poses for physical feasibility and task alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that ZeroDexGrasp enables high-quality zero-shot dexterous grasping on diverse unseen object categories and complex task requirements, advancing toward more generalizable and intelligent robotic grasping.
