**一句话要点**：提出体积遍历控制方法，优化机器人空间覆盖效率

**关键词**：遍历控制, 体积表示, 机器人覆盖, 实时控制, 空间优化

## 3 点简述
- 现有遍历控制将机器人建模为无体积点，忽略实际体积交互问题
- 新方法使用体积状态表示，保持覆盖保证并支持实时控制
- 实验显示覆盖效率提升超两倍，任务完成率100%，优于标准方法

## 摘要（原文）

> Ergodic control synthesizes optimal coverage behaviors over spatial distributions for nonlinear systems. However, existing formulations model the robot as a non-volumetric point, but in practice a robot interacts with the environment through its body and sensors with physical volume. In this work, we introduce a new ergodic control formulation that optimizes spatial coverage using a volumetric state representation. Our method preserves the asymptotic coverage guarantees of ergodic control, adds minimal computational overhead for real-time control, and supports arbitrary sample-based volumetric models. We evaluate our method across search and manipulation tasks -- with multiple robot dynamics and end-effector geometries or sensor models -- and show that it improves coverage efficiency by more than a factor of two while maintaining a 100% task completion rate across all experiments, outperforming the standard ergodic control method. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a robot arm performing mechanical erasing tasks.
