**关键词**：注视目标检测, 自闭症谱系障碍, 类别不平衡, 上下文感知, 双路径架构, AGT数据集

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：自闭症儿童注视目标检测中类别不平衡，因较少注视面部导致数据偏差。
- 方法要点：采用双路径架构，结合社交与非社交专家模型，通过上下文感知门模块优化。
- 实验或效果：在AGT数据集上实现SOTA性能，显著提升面部注视类别的检测准确率。

## 摘要（原文）

> The automatic detection of gaze targets in autistic children through artificial intelligence can be impactful, especially for those who lack access to a sufficient number of professionals to improve their quality of life. This paper introduces a new, real-world AI application for gaze target detection in autistic children, which predicts a child's point of gaze from an activity image. This task is foundational for building automated systems that can measure joint attention-a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To facilitate the study of this challenging application, we collected the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset. We further propose a novel Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that explicitly leverages the social context of a scene to overcome the class imbalance common in autism datasets-a consequence of autistic children's tendency to show reduced gaze to faces. It utilizes a two-pathway architecture with expert models specialized in social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module. The results of our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection in this population, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.
