## 摘要（原文）

> Precipitation nowcasting, predicting future radar echo sequences from current
> observations, is a critical yet challenging task due to the inherently chaotic
> and tightly coupled spatio-temporal dynamics of the atmosphere. While recent
> advances in diffusion-based models attempt to capture both large-scale motion
> and fine-grained stochastic variability, they often suffer from scalability
> issues: latent-space approaches require a separately trained autoencoder,
> adding complexity and limiting generalization, while pixel-space approaches are
> computationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their
> ability to model long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To address these
> limitations, we propose a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the
> U-Net diffusion model but also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically
> captures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution. Unlike prior
> approaches, our method natively integrates attention into the architecture
> without incurring the high resource cost typical of pixel-space diffusion,
> thereby eliminating the need for separate latent modules. Our extensive
> experiments and visual evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate that the
> proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, yielding
> superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex
> precipitation forecasting scenarios.
