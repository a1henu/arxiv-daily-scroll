**一句话要点**：提出RL4Seg3D框架，用于无监督领域自适应的心动图时空分割。

**关键词**：无监督领域自适应, 心动图分割, 强化学习, 时空一致性, 不确定性估计

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：领域自适应方法在目标域可靠性低，心动图分割受噪声和时空不一致影响。
- 方法要点：集成强化学习、新奖励函数和融合方案，提升分割精度和时空一致性。
- 实验或效果：在3万+心动图视频上验证，优于标准方法，无需目标域标签。

## 摘要（原文）

> Domain adaptation methods aim to bridge the gap between datasets by enabling
> knowledge transfer across domains, reducing the need for additional expert
> annotations. However, many approaches struggle with reliability in the target
> domain, an issue particularly critical in medical image segmentation, where
> accuracy and anatomical validity are essential. This challenge is further
> exacerbated in spatio-temporal data, where the lack of temporal consistency can
> significantly degrade segmentation quality, and particularly in
> echocardiography, where the presence of artifacts and noise can further hinder
> segmentation performance. To address these issues, we present RL4Seg3D, an
> unsupervised domain adaptation framework for 2D + time echocardiography
> segmentation. RL4Seg3D integrates novel reward functions and a fusion scheme to
> enhance key landmark precision in its segmentations while processing full-sized
> input videos. By leveraging reinforcement learning for image segmentation, our
> approach improves accuracy, anatomical validity, and temporal consistency while
> also providing, as a beneficial side effect, a robust uncertainty estimator,
> which can be used at test time to further enhance segmentation performance. We
> demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on over 30,000 echocardiographic
> videos, showing that it outperforms standard domain adaptation techniques
> without the need for any labels on the target domain. Code is available at
