## 摘要（原文）

> Motherboard defect detection is critical for ensuring reliability in
> high-volume electronics manufacturing. While prior research in PCB inspection
> has largely targeted bare-board or trace-level defects, assembly-level
> inspection of full motherboards inspection remains underexplored. In this work,
> we present BoardVision, a reproducible framework for detecting assembly-level
> defects such as missing screws, loose fan wiring, and surface scratches. We
> benchmark two representative detectors - YOLOv7 and Faster R-CNN, under
> controlled conditions on the MiracleFactory motherboard dataset, providing the
> first systematic comparison in this domain. To mitigate the limitations of
> single models, where YOLO excels in precision but underperforms in recall and
> Faster R-CNN shows the reverse, we propose a lightweight ensemble,
> Confidence-Temporal Voting (CTV Voter), that balances precision and recall
> through interpretable rules. We further evaluate robustness under realistic
> perturbations including sharpness, brightness, and orientation changes,
> highlighting stability challenges often overlooked in motherboard defect
> detection. Finally, we release a deployable GUI-driven inspection tool that
> bridges research evaluation with operator usability. Together, these
> contributions demonstrate how computer vision techniques can transition from
> benchmark results to practical quality assurance for assembly-level motherboard
> manufacturing.
