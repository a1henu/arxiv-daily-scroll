## 摘要（原文）

> Tactical understanding in badminton involves interpreting not only individual
> actions but also how tactics are dynamically executed over time. In this paper,
> we propose \textbf{Shot2Tactic-Caption}, a novel framework for semantic and
> temporal multi-scale video captioning in badminton, capable of generating
> shot-level captions that describe individual actions and tactic-level captions
> that capture how these actions unfold over time within a tactical execution. We
> also introduce the Shot2Tactic-Caption Dataset, the first badminton captioning
> dataset containing 5,494 shot captions and 544 tactic captions.
> Shot2Tactic-Caption adopts a dual-branch design, with both branches including a
> visual encoder, a spatio-temporal Transformer encoder, and a Transformer-based
> decoder to generate shot and tactic captions. To support tactic captioning, we
> additionally introduce a Tactic Unit Detector that identifies valid tactic
> units, tactic types, and tactic states (e.g., Interrupt, Resume). For tactic
> captioning, we further incorporate a shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism, where
> the predicted tactic type and state are embedded as prompts and injected into
> the decoder via cross-attention. The shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism enables
> our system not only to describe successfully executed tactics but also to
> capture tactical executions that are temporarily interrupted and later resumed.
> Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
> generating both shot and tactic captions. Ablation studies show that the
> ResNet50-based spatio-temporal encoder outperforms other variants, and that
> shot-wise prompt structuring leads to more coherent and accurate tactic
> captioning.
