**一句话要点**：提出基于乳腺密度的多模态AI框架，以提升不同密度乳腺癌检测性能

**关键词**：乳腺癌检测, 多模态AI, 乳腺密度, 热成像, 深度学习, 放射组学

## 3 点简述
- 乳腺X线摄影在致密乳腺组织中敏感性降低，导致漏诊或延迟诊断
- 结合乳腺X线AI和热成像AI，根据乳腺密度动态选择最优模态
- 多模态框架敏感性达94.55%，优于单模态方法，尤其在致密乳腺中表现稳定

## 摘要（原文）

> Mammography, the current standard for breast cancer screening, has reduced
> sensitivity in women with dense breast tissue, contributing to missed or
> delayed diagnoses. Thermalytix, an AI-based thermal imaging modality, captures
> functional vascular and metabolic cues that may complement mammographic
> structural data. This study investigates whether a breast density-informed
> multi-modal AI framework can improve cancer detection by dynamically selecting
> the appropriate imaging modality based on breast tissue composition. A total of
> 324 women underwent both mammography and thermal imaging. Mammography images
> were analyzed using a multi-view deep learning model, while Thermalytix
> assessed thermal images through vascular and thermal radiomics. The proposed
> framework utilized Mammography AI for fatty breasts and Thermalytix AI for
> dense breasts, optimizing predictions based on tissue type. This multi-modal AI
> framework achieved a sensitivity of 94.55% (95% CI: 88.54-100) and specificity
> of 79.93% (95% CI: 75.14-84.71), outperforming standalone mammography AI
> (sensitivity 81.82%, specificity 86.25%) and Thermalytix AI (sensitivity
> 92.73%, specificity 75.46%). Importantly, the sensitivity of Mammography
> dropped significantly in dense breasts (67.86%) versus fatty breasts (96.30%),
> whereas Thermalytix AI maintained high and consistent sensitivity in both
> (92.59% and 92.86%, respectively). This demonstrates that a density-informed
> multi-modal AI framework can overcome key limitations of unimodal screening and
> deliver high performance across diverse breast compositions. The proposed
> framework is interpretable, low-cost, and easily deployable, offering a
> practical path to improving breast cancer screening outcomes in both
> high-resource and resource-limited settings.
