**一句话要点**：提出DOS方法以解决多对象图像生成中的对象忽略与混合问题

**关键词**：文本到图像生成, 多对象生成, CLIP嵌入, 对象分离, 图像质量提升

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：多对象文本提示下，图像生成模型易出现对象忽略或混合，尤其在相似形状、纹理、背景偏差和对象过多场景。
- 方法要点：基于CLIP嵌入观察，修改三种文本嵌入类型，实现对象方向性分离，提升多对象生成准确性。
- 实验或效果：在人类评估中，DOS显著优于四种竞争方法，成功率提升26.24%-43.04%，减少对象混合。

## 摘要（原文）

> Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generative models has led to
> significant improvements in generating high-quality images aligned with text
> prompts. However, these models still struggle with prompts involving multiple
> objects, often resulting in object neglect or object mixing. Through extensive
> studies, we identify four problematic scenarios, Similar Shapes, Similar
> Textures, Dissimilar Background Biases, and Many Objects, where inter-object
> relationships frequently lead to such failures. Motivated by two key
> observations about CLIP embeddings, we propose DOS (Directional Object
> Separation), a method that modifies three types of CLIP text embeddings before
> passing them into text-to-image models. Experimental results show that DOS
> consistently improves the success rate of multi-object image generation and
> reduces object mixing. In human evaluations, DOS significantly outperforms four
> competing methods, receiving 26.24%-43.04% more votes across four benchmarks.
> These results highlight DOS as a practical and effective solution for improving
> multi-object image generation.
