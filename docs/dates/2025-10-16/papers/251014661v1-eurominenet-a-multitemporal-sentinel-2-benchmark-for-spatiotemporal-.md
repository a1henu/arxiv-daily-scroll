**作者**：Weikang Yu, Vincent Nwazelibe, Xianping Ma, Xiaokang Zhang, Richard Gloaguen, Xiao Xiang Zhu, Pedram Ghamisi  

**一句话要点**：提出EuroMineNet基准以解决欧盟采矿足迹长期监测问题

**关键词**：多时相遥感, 采矿足迹监测, GeoAI基准, 环境变化检测, Sentinel-2影像, 可持续发展

## 3 点简述
- 采矿活动导致环境退化，现有数据集时空覆盖不足
- 基于Sentinel-2影像提供多时相采矿足迹标注，支持GeoAI模型分析
- 基准20种深度学习模型，揭示长期变化检测有效但短期动态挑战未知

## 摘要（原文）

> Mining activities are essential for industrial and economic development, but
> remain a leading source of environmental degradation, contributing to
> deforestation, soil erosion, and water contamination. Sustainable resource
> management and environmental governance require consistent, long-term
> monitoring of mining-induced land surface changes, yet existing datasets are
> often limited in temporal depth or geographic scope. To address this gap, we
> present EuroMineNet, the first comprehensive multitemporal benchmark for mining
> footprint mapping and monitoring based on Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery.
> Spanning 133 mining sites across the European Union, EuroMineNet provides
> annual observations and expert-verified annotations from 2015 to 2024, enabling
> GeoAI-based models to analyze environmental dynamics at a continental scale. It
> supports two sustainability-driven tasks: (1) multitemporal mining footprint
> mapping for consistent annual land-use delineation, evaluated with a novel
> Change-Aware Temporal IoU (CA-TIoU) metric, and (2) cross-temporal change
> detection to capture both gradual and abrupt surface transformations.
> Benchmarking 20 state-of-the-art deep learning models reveals that while GeoAI
> methods effectively identify long-term environmental changes, challenges remain
> in detecting short-term dynamics critical for timely mitigation. By advancing
> temporally consistent and explainable mining monitoring, EuroMineNet
> contributes to sustainable land-use management, environmental resilience, and
> the broader goal of applying GeoAI for social and environmental good. We
> release the codes and datasets by aligning with FAIR and the open science
> paradigm at https://github.com/EricYu97/EuroMineNet.
