**一句话要点**：提出Alpha-Service框架，通过AI眼镜实现主动实时服务辅助。

**关键词**：主动AI服务, AI眼镜, 多代理系统, 个性化辅助, 实时感知

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：现有AI服务多为被动响应，无法主动预测用户需求。
- 方法要点：基于von Neumann架构，构建多组件系统以检测服务机会并提供个性化服务。
- 实验或效果：案例研究展示在Blackjack、博物馆导览等场景中实现无缝感知与及时辅助。

## 摘要（原文）

> In an era where AI is evolving from a passive tool into an active and
> adaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm
> that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI
> services remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We
> argue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of
> anticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To
> realize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that
> addresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting
> service opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide
> both generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann
> computer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five
> key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for
> task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit
> for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human
> interaction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a
> multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time
> Blackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant,
> demonstrate its ability to seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user
> intent, and provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.
