## 摘要（原文）

> Building robots is an engaging activity that provides opportunities for
> hands-on learning. However, traditional robot-building kits are usually costly
> with limited functionality due to material and technology constraints. To
> improve the accessibility and flexibility of such kits, we take paper as the
> building material and extensively explore the versatility of paper-based
> interactions. Based on an analysis of current robot-building kits and
> paper-based interaction research, we propose a design space for devising paper
> robots. We also analyzed our building kit designs using this design space,
> where these kits demonstrate the potential of paper as a cost-effective
> material for robot building. As a starting point, our design space and building
> kit examples provide a guideline that inspires and informs future research and
> development of novel paper robot-building kits.
