**一句话要点**：提出MACE方法以解决大规模场景定位与渲染中的计算效率问题

**关键词**：场景坐标回归, 混合专家模型, 门控网络, 负载均衡, 大规模场景定位, 高效渲染

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：大规模场景定位与渲染计算成本高，单网络容量不足。
- 方法要点：引入门控网络选择子网络，仅激活单个子网络进行推理。
- 实验效果：在剑桥测试集上，仅10分钟训练即可实现高质量渲染。

## 摘要（原文）

> Efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes
> remain a significant challenge due to the computational cost involved. While
> Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods perform well in small-scale
> localization, they are limited by the capacity of a single network when
> extended to large-scale scenes. To address these challenges, we propose the
> Mixed Expert-based Accelerated Coordinate Encoding method (MACE), which enables
> efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes.
> Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of MOE in large model domains, we
> introduce a gating network to implicitly classify and select sub-networks,
> ensuring that only a single sub-network is activated during each inference.
> Furtheremore, we present Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing(ALF-LB) strategy to
> enhance the localization accuracy on large-scale scene. Our framework provides
> a significant reduction in costs while maintaining higher precision, offering
> an efficient solution for large-scale scene applications. Additional
> experiments on the Cambridge test set demonstrate that our method achieves
> high-quality rendering results with merely 10 minutes of training.
