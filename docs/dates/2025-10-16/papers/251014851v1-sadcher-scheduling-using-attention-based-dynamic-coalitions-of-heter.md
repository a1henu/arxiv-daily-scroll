## 摘要（原文）

> We present Sadcher, a real-time task assignment framework for heterogeneous
> multi-robot teams that incorporates dynamic coalition formation and task
> precedence constraints. Sadcher is trained through Imitation Learning and
> combines graph attention and transformers to predict assignment rewards between
> robots and tasks. Based on the predicted rewards, a relaxed bipartite matching
> step generates high-quality schedules with feasibility guarantees. We
> explicitly model robot and task positions, task durations, and robots'
> remaining processing times, enabling advanced temporal and spatial reasoning
> and generalization to environments with different spatiotemporal distributions
> compared to training. Trained on optimally solved small-scale instances, our
> method can scale to larger task sets and team sizes. Sadcher outperforms other
> learning-based and heuristic baselines on randomized, unseen problems for small
> and medium-sized teams with computation times suitable for real-time operation.
> We also explore sampling-based variants and evaluate scalability across robot
> and task counts. In addition, we release our dataset of 250,000 optimal
> schedules: https://autonomousrobots.nl/paper_websites/sadcher_MRTA/
