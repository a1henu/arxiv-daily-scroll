- 实验显示BD-rate平均降低10.7%，保持实时性能，帧质量更稳定。

## 摘要（原文）

> Neural video compression (NVC) technologies have advanced rapidly in recent
> years, yielding state-of-the-art schemes such as DCVC-RT that offer superior
> compression efficiency to H.266/VVC and real-time encoding/decoding
> capabilities. Nonetheless, existing NVC schemes have several limitations,
> including inefficiency in dealing with disocclusion and new content, interframe
> error propagation and accumulation, among others. To eliminate these
> limitations, we borrow the idea from classic video coding schemes, which allow
> intra coding within inter-coded frames. With the intra coding tool enabled,
> disocclusion and new content are properly handled, and interframe error
> propagation is naturally intercepted without the need for manual refresh
> mechanisms. We present an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding,
> where every frame is processed by a single model that is trained to perform
> intra/inter coding adaptively. Moreover, we propose a simultaneous two-frame
> compression design to exploit interframe redundancy not only forwardly but also
> backwardly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms DCVC-RT by an
> average of 10.7\% BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality
> per frame, and retains real-time encoding/decoding performances. Code and
> models will be released.
