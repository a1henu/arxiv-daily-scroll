## 摘要（原文）

> This paper establishes analytical stability criteria for robot-mediated
> human-human (dyadic) interaction systems, focusing on haptic communication
> under network-induced time delays. Through frequency-domain analysis supported
> by numerical simulations, we identify both delay-independent and
> delay-dependent stability criteria. The delay-independent criterion guarantees
> stability irrespective of the delay, whereas the delay-dependent criterion is
> characterised by a maximum tolerable delay before instability occurs. The
> criteria demonstrate dependence on controller and robot dynamic parameters,
> where increasing stiffness reduces the maximum tolerable delay in a non-linear
> manner, thereby heightening system vulnerability. The proposed criteria can be
> generalised to a wide range of robot-mediated interactions and serve as design
> guidelines for stable remote dyadic systems. Experiments with robots performing
> human-like movements further illustrate the correlation between stability and
> motor performance. The findings of this paper suggest the prerequisites for
> effective delay-compensation strategies.
