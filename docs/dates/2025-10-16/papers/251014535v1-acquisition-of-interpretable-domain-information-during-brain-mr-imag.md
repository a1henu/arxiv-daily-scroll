## 摘要（原文）

> Medical images like MR scans often show domain shifts across imaging sites
> due to scanner and protocol differences, which degrade machine learning
> performance in tasks such as disease classification. Domain harmonization is
> thus a critical research focus. Recent approaches encode brain images
> $\boldsymbol{x}$ into a low-dimensional latent space $\boldsymbol{z}$, then
> disentangle it into $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ (domain-invariant) and
> $\boldsymbol{z_d}$ (domain-specific), achieving strong results. However, these
> methods often lack interpretability$-$an essential requirement in medical
> applications$-$leaving practical issues unresolved. We propose
> Pseudo-Linear-Style Encoder Adversarial Domain Adaptation (PL-SE-ADA), a
> general framework for domain harmonization and interpretable representation
> learning that preserves disease-relevant information in brain MR images.
> PL-SE-ADA includes two encoders $f_E$ and $f_{SE}$ to extract
> $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$, a decoder to reconstruct the image
> $f_D$, and a domain predictor $g_D$. Beyond adversarial training between the
> encoder and domain predictor, the model learns to reconstruct the input image
> $\boldsymbol{x}$ by summing reconstructions from $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and
> $\boldsymbol{z_d}$, ensuring both harmonization and informativeness. Compared
> to prior methods, PL-SE-ADA achieves equal or better performance in image
> reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition. It also enables
> visualization of both domain-independent brain features and domain-specific
> components, offering high interpretability across the entire framework.
