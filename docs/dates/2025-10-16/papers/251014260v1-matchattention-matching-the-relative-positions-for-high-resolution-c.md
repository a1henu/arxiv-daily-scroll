## 摘要（原文）

> Cross-view matching is fundamentally achieved through cross-attention
> mechanisms. However, matching of high-resolution images remains challenging due
> to the quadratic complexity and lack of explicit matching constraints in the
> existing cross-attention. This paper proposes an attention mechanism,
> MatchAttention, that dynamically matches relative positions. The relative
> position determines the attention sampling center of the key-value pairs given
> a query. Continuous and differentiable sliding-window attention sampling is
> achieved by the proposed BilinearSoftmax. The relative positions are
> iteratively updated through residual connections across layers by embedding
> them into the feature channels. Since the relative position is exactly the
> learning target for cross-view matching, an efficient hierarchical cross-view
> decoder, MatchDecoder, is designed with MatchAttention as its core component.
> To handle cross-view occlusions, gated cross-MatchAttention and a
> consistency-constrained loss are proposed. These two components collectively
> mitigate the impact of occlusions in both forward and backward passes, allowing
> the model to focus more on learning matching relationships. When applied to
> stereo matching, MatchStereo-B ranked 1st in average error on the public
> Middlebury benchmark and requires only 29ms for KITTI-resolution inference.
> MatchStereo-T can process 4K UHD images in 0.1 seconds using only 3GB of GPU
> memory. The proposed models also achieve state-of-the-art performance on KITTI
> 2012, KITTI 2015, ETH3D, and Spring flow datasets. The combination of high
> accuracy and low computational complexity makes real-time, high-resolution, and
> high-accuracy cross-view matching possible. Code is available at
