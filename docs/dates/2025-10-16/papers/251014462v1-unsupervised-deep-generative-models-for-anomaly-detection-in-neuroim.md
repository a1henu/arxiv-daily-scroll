## 摘要（原文）

> Unsupervised deep generative models are emerging as a promising alternative
> to supervised methods for detecting and segmenting anomalies in brain imaging.
> Unlike fully supervised approaches, which require large voxel-level annotated
> datasets and are limited to well-characterised pathologies, these models can be
> trained exclusively on healthy data and identify anomalies as deviations from
> learned normative brain structures. This PRISMA-guided scoping review
> synthesises recent work on unsupervised deep generative models for anomaly
> detection in neuroimaging, including autoencoders, variational autoencoders,
> generative adversarial networks, and denoising diffusion models. A total of 49
> studies published between 2018 - 2025 were identified, covering applications to
> brain MRI and, less frequently, CT across diverse pathologies such as tumours,
> stroke, multiple sclerosis, and small vessel disease. Reported performance
> metrics are compared alongside architectural design choices. Across the
> included studies, generative models achieved encouraging performance for large
> focal lesions and demonstrated progress in addressing more subtle
> abnormalities. A key strength of generative models is their ability to produce
> interpretable pseudo-healthy (also referred to as counterfactual)
> reconstructions, which is particularly valuable when annotated data are scarce,
> as in rare or heterogeneous diseases. Looking ahead, these models offer a
> compelling direction for anomaly detection, enabling semi-supervised learning,
> supporting the discovery of novel imaging biomarkers, and facilitating within-
> and cross-disease deviation mapping in unified end-to-end frameworks. To
> realise clinical impact, future work should prioritise anatomy-aware modelling,
> development of foundation models, task-appropriate evaluation metrics, and
> rigorous clinical validation.
