**一句话要点**：提出生成预测控制框架，通过引导采样优化接触丰富的机器人操作

**关键词**：生成预测控制, 采样模型预测控制, 条件流匹配, 机器人操作, 接触丰富任务, 样本效率

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：采样模型预测控制在接触丰富操作中效率低、规划需求高
- 方法要点：使用条件流匹配模型从模拟数据学习提议分布，提升在线采样
- 实验或效果：在仿真和硬件中提高样本效率、减少规划需求，并泛化任务变化

## 摘要（原文）

> We present a generative predictive control (GPC) framework that amortizes
> sampling-based Model Predictive Control (SPC) by bootstrapping it with
> conditional flow-matching models trained on SPC control sequences collected in
> simulation. Unlike prior work relying on iterative refinement or gradient-based
> solvers, we show that meaningful proposal distributions can be learned directly
> from noisy SPC data, enabling more efficient and informed sampling during
> online planning. We further demonstrate, for the first time, the application of
> this approach to real-world contact-rich loco-manipulation with a quadruped
> robot. Extensive experiments in simulation and on hardware show that our method
> improves sample efficiency, reduces planning horizon requirements, and
> generalizes robustly across task variations.
