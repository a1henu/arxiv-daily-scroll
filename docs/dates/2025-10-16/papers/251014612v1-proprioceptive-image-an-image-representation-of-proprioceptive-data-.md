## 摘要（原文）

> This paper presents a novel approach for representing proprioceptive
> time-series data from quadruped robots as structured two-dimensional images,
> enabling the use of convolutional neural networks for learning
> locomotion-related tasks. The proposed method encodes temporal dynamics from
> multiple proprioceptive signals, such as joint positions, IMU readings, and
> foot velocities, while preserving the robot's morphological structure in the
> spatial arrangement of the image. This transformation captures inter-signal
> correlations and gait-dependent patterns, providing a richer feature space than
> direct time-series processing. We apply this concept in the problem of contact
> estimation, a key capability for stable and adaptive locomotion on diverse
> terrains. Experimental evaluations on both real-world datasets and simulated
> environments show that our image-based representation consistently enhances
> prediction accuracy and generalization over conventional sequence-based models,
> underscoring the potential of cross-modal encoding strategies for robotic state
> learning. Our method achieves superior performance on the contact dataset,
> improving contact state accuracy from 87.7% to 94.5% over the recently proposed
> MI-HGNN method, using a 15 times shorter window size.
