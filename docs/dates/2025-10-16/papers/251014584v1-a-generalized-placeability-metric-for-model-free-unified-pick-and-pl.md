**作者**：Benno Wingender, Nils Dengler, Rohit Menon, Sicong Pan, Maren Bennewitz  

**一句话要点**：提出广义可放置性度量，用于无模型统一拾放推理，处理未知物体和噪声点云。

**关键词**：拾放推理, 可放置性度量, 点云处理, 稳定性预测, 无模型方法

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：未知物体在噪声点云下可靠拾放受限，现有方法依赖物体先验或平面假设。
- 方法要点：从点云提取支撑面，生成多方向放置候选，联合评分稳定性、可抓取性和间隙。
- 实验或效果：在未见真实物体和非平面支撑上，预测稳定性损失精度与CAD相当。

## 摘要（原文）

> To reliably pick and place unknown objects under real-world sensing noise
> remains a challenging task, as existing methods rely on strong object priors
> (e.g., CAD models), or planar-support assumptions, limiting generalization and
> unified reasoning between grasping and placing. In this work, we introduce a
> generalized placeability metric that evaluates placement poses directly from
> noisy point clouds, without any shape priors. The metric jointly scores
> stability, graspability, and clearance. From raw geometry, we extract the
> support surfaces of the object to generate diverse candidates for
> multi-orientation placement and sample contacts that satisfy collision and
> stability constraints. By conditioning grasp scores on each candidate
> placement, our proposed method enables model-free unified pick-and-place
> reasoning and selects grasp-place pairs that lead to stable, collision-free
> placements. On unseen real objects and non-planar object supports, our metric
> delivers CAD-comparable accuracy in predicting stability loss and generally
> produces more physically plausible placements than learning-based predictors.
