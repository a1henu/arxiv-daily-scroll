## 摘要（原文）

> Robust humanoid locomotion in unstructured environments requires
> architectures that balance fast low-level stabilization with slower perceptual
> decision-making. We show that a simple layered control architecture (LCA), a
> proprioceptive stabilizer running at high rate, coupled with a compact low-rate
> perceptual policy, enables substantially more robust performance than
> monolithic end-to-end designs, even when using minimal perception encoders.
> Through a two-stage training curriculum (blind stabilizer pretraining followed
> by perceptual fine-tuning), we demonstrate that layered policies consistently
> outperform one-stage alternatives in both simulation and hardware. On a Unitree
> G1 humanoid, our approach succeeds across stair and ledge tasks where one-stage
> perceptual policies fail. These results highlight that architectural separation
> of timescales, rather than network scale or complexity, is the key enabler for
> robust perception-conditioned locomotion.
