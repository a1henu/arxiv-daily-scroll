## 摘要（原文）

> Accurate and high-fidelity demonstration data acquisition is a critical
> bottleneck for deploying robot Imitation Learning (IL) systems, particularly
> when dealing with heterogeneous robotic platforms. Existing teleoperation
> systems often fail to guarantee high-precision data collection across diverse
> types of teleoperation devices. To address this, we developed Open TeleDex, a
> unified teleoperation framework engineered for demonstration data collection.
> Open TeleDex specifically tackles the TripleAny challenge, seamlessly
> supporting any robotic arm, any dexterous hand, and any external input device.
> Furthermore, we propose a novel hand pose retargeting algorithm that
> significantly boosts the interoperability of Open TeleDex, enabling robust and
> accurate compatibility with an even wider spectrum of heterogeneous master and
> slave equipment. Open TeleDex establishes a foundational, high-quality, and
> publicly available platform for accelerating both academic research and
> industry development in complex robotic manipulation and IL.
