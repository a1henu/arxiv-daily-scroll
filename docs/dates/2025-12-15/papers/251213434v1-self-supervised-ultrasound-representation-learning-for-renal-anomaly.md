## 摘要（原文）

> Prenatal ultrasound is the cornerstone for detecting congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, but diagnosis is limited by operator dependence and suboptimal imaging conditions. We sought to assess the performance of a self-supervised ultrasound foundation model for automated fetal renal anomaly classification using a curated dataset of 969 two-dimensional ultrasound images. A pretrained Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE) was fine-tuned for binary and multi-class classification of normal kidneys, urinary tract dilation, and multicystic dysplastic kidney. Models were compared with a DenseNet-169 convolutional baseline using cross-validation and an independent test set. USF-MAE consistently improved upon the baseline across all evaluation metrics in both binary and multi-class settings. USF-MAE achieved an improvement of about 1.87% (AUC) and 7.8% (F1-score) on the validation set, 2.32% (AUC) and 4.33% (F1-score) on the independent holdout test set. The largest gains were observed in the multi-class setting, where the improvement in AUC was 16.28% and 46.15% in F1-score. To facilitate model interpretability, Score-CAM visualizations were adapted for a transformer architecture and show that model predictions were informed by known, clinically relevant renal structures, including the renal pelvis in urinary tract dilation and cystic regions in multicystic dysplastic kidney. These results show that ultrasound-specific self-supervised learning can generate a useful representation as a foundation for downstream diagnostic tasks. The proposed framework offers a robust, interpretable approach to support the prenatal detection of renal anomalies and demonstrates the promise of foundation models in obstetric imaging.
