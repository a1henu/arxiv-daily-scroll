## 摘要（原文）

> Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) have become indispensable in industrial applications due to their operational flexibility and efficiency. Navigation serves as a crucial technical foundation for accomplishing complex tasks. However, navigating AMRs in dense, cluttered, and semi-structured environments remains challenging, primarily due to nonholonomic vehicle dynamics, interactions with mixed static/dynamic obstacles, and the non-convex constrained nature of such operational spaces. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an Improved Sequential Model Predictive Control (ISMPC) navigation framework that systematically reformulates navigation tasks as sequential switched optimal control problems. The framework addresses the aforementioned challenges through two key innovations: 1) Implementation of a Multi-Directional Safety Rectangular Corridor (MDSRC) algorithm, which encodes the free space through rectangular convex regions to avoid collision with static obstacles, eliminating redundant computational burdens and accelerating solver convergence; 2) A sequential MPC navigation framework that integrates corridor constraints with barrier function constraints is proposed to achieve static and dynamic obstacle avoidance. The ISMPC navigation framework enables direct velocity generation for AMRs, simplifying traditional navigation algorithm architectures. Comparative experiments demonstrate the framework's superiority in free-space utilization ( an increase of 41.05$\%$ in the average corridor area) while maintaining real-time computational performance (average corridors generation latency of 3 ms).
