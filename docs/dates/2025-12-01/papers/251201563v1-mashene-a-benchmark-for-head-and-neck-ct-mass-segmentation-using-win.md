**一句话要点**：提出MasHeNe数据集与WEMF模型，用于头颈部CT肿块分割，超越仅恶性病变的基准。

**关键词**：头颈部肿块分割, CT图像分割, Mamba模型, 多频注意力, 三窗增强, 医学影像数据集

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：现有公开数据集主要关注恶性病变，忽略头颈部其他占位性病变，缺乏全面基准。
- 方法要点：WEMF模型采用三窗增强丰富输入外观，并在U形Mamba骨干中通过多频注意力融合跳跃连接信息。
- 实验或效果：在MasHeNe数据集上，WEMF达到最佳性能，Dice为70.45%，表明该任务仍具挑战性。

## 摘要（原文）

> Head and neck masses are space-occupying lesions that can compress the airway and esophagus and may affect nerves and blood vessels. Available public datasets primarily focus on malignant lesions and often overlook other space-occupying conditions in this region. To address this gap, we introduce MasHeNe, an initial dataset of 3,779 contrast-enhanced CT slices that includes both tumors and cysts with pixel-level annotations. We also establish a benchmark using standard segmentation baselines and report common metrics to enable fair comparison. In addition, we propose the Windowing-Enhanced Mamba with Frequency integration (WEMF) model. WEMF applies tri-window enhancement to enrich the input appearance before feature extraction. It further uses multi-frequency attention to fuse information across skip connections within a U-shaped Mamba backbone. On MasHeNe, WEMF attains the best performance among evaluated methods, with a Dice of 70.45%, IoU of 66.89%, NSD of 72.33%, and HD95 of 5.12 mm. This model indicates stable and strong results on this challenging task. MasHeNe provides a benchmark for head-and-neck mass segmentation beyond malignancy-only datasets. The observed error patterns also suggest that this task remains challenging and requires further research. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/drthaodao3101/MasHeNe.git.
