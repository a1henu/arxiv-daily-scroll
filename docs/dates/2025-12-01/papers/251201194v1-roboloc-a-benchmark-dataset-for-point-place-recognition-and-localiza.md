## 摘要（原文）

> Robust place recognition is essential for reliable localization in robotics, particularly in complex environments with fre- quent indoor-outdoor transitions. However, existing LiDAR-based datasets often focus on outdoor scenarios and lack seamless domain shifts. In this paper, we propose RoboLoc, a benchmark dataset designed for GPS-free place recognition in indoor-outdoor environments with floor transitions. RoboLoc features real-world robot trajectories, diverse elevation profiles, and transitions between structured indoor and unstructured outdoor domains. We benchmark a variety of state-of-the-art models, point-based, voxel-based, and BEV-based architectures, highlighting their generalizability domain shifts. RoboLoc provides a realistic testbed for developing multi-domain localization systems in robotics and autonomous navigation
