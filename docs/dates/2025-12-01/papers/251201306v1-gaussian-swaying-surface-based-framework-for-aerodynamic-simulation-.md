## 摘要（原文）

> Branches swaying in the breeze, flags rippling in the wind, and boats rocking on the water all show how aerodynamics shape natural motion -- an effect crucial for realism in vision and graphics. In this paper, we present Gaussian Swaying, a surface-based framework for aerodynamic simulation using 3D Gaussians. Unlike mesh-based methods that require costly meshing, or particle-based approaches that rely on discrete positional data, Gaussian Swaying models surfaces continuously with 3D Gaussians, enabling efficient and fine-grained aerodynamic interaction. Our framework unifies simulation and rendering on the same representation: Gaussian patches, which support force computation for dynamics while simultaneously providing normals for lightweight shading. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets across multiple metrics demonstrate that Gaussian Swaying achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency, offering a scalable approach for realistic aerodynamic scene simulation.
