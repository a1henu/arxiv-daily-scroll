## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：胎儿MRI扫描中头部运动导致姿态模糊，现有方法因解剖对称性、低分辨率、噪声和伪影而泛化困难。
- 方法要点：E(3)-Pose显式建模旋转等变性和解剖对称性，构建鲁棒的胎儿头部姿态估计模型。
- 实验或效果：在公开和临床胎儿MRI数据集上验证，E(3)-Pose实现领域间鲁棒泛化，临床MRI体积上达到最先进精度。

## 摘要（原文）

> We present E(3)-Pose, a novel fast pose estimation method that jointly and explicitly models rotation equivariance and object symmetry. Our work is motivated by the challenging problem of accounting for fetal head motion during a diagnostic MRI scan. We aim to enable automatic adaptive prescription of 2D diagnostic MRI slices with 6-DoF head pose estimation, supported by 3D MRI volumes rapidly acquired before each 2D slice. Existing methods struggle to generalize to clinical volumes, due to pose ambiguities induced by inherent anatomical symmetries, as well as low resolution, noise, and artifacts. In contrast, E(3)-Pose captures anatomical symmetries and rigid pose equivariance by construction, and yields robust estimates of the fetal head pose. Our experiments on publicly available and representative clinical fetal MRI datasets demonstrate the superior robustness and generalization of our method across domains. Crucially, E(3)-Pose achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on clinical MRI volumes, paving the way for clinical translation. Our implementation is available at github.com/ramyamut/E3-Pose.
