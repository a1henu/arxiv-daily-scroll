## 3 点简述
- 研究在线讨论中讽刺检测的挑战，因字面与意图常矛盾。
- 采用词级与字符级TF-IDF特征及风格指标，评估四种经典模型。
- 朴素贝叶斯和逻辑回归表现最佳，讽刺评论F1分数约0.57。

## 摘要（原文）

> Sarcasm is common in online discussions, yet difficult for machines to identify because the intended meaning often contradicts the literal wording. In this work, I study sarcasm detection using only classical machine learning methods and explicit feature engineering, without relying on neural networks or context from parent comments. Using a 100,000-comment subsample of the Self-Annotated Reddit Corpus (SARC 2.0), I combine word-level and character-level TF-IDF features with simple stylistic indicators. Four models are evaluated: logistic regression, a linear SVM, multinomial Naive Bayes, and a random forest. Naive Bayes and logistic regression perform the strongest, achieving F1-scores around 0.57 for sarcastic comments. Although the lack of conversational context limits performance, the results offer a clear and reproducible baseline for sarcasm detection using lightweight and interpretable methods.
