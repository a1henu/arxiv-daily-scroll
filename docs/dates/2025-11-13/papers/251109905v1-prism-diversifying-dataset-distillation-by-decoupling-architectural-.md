**一句话要点**：提出PRISM框架以解决数据集蒸馏中单一教师模型偏差问题

**关键词**：数据集蒸馏, 模型偏差解耦, 多教师学习, 特征多样性, 批量归一化对齐

## 3 点简述
- 数据集蒸馏方法常受单一教师模型归纳偏差影响，导致样本同质化
- PRISM通过解耦对数匹配和正则化目标，使用不同教师架构监督
- 在ImageNet-1K上优于现有方法，提升类内多样性并降低特征余弦相似度

## 摘要（原文）

> Dataset distillation (DD) promises compact yet faithful synthetic data, but existing approaches often inherit the inductive bias of a single teacher model. As dataset size increases, this bias drives generation toward overly smooth, homogeneous samples, reducing intra-class diversity and limiting generalization. We present PRISM (PRIors from diverse Source Models), a framework that disentangles architectural priors during synthesis. PRISM decouples the logit-matching and regularization objectives, supervising them with different teacher architectures: a primary model for logits and a stochastic subset for batch-normalization (BN) alignment. On ImageNet-1K, PRISM consistently and reproducibly outperforms single-teacher methods (e.g., SRe2L) and recent multi-teacher variants (e.g., G-VBSM) at low- and mid-IPC regimes. The generated data also show significantly richer intra-class diversity, as reflected by a notable drop in cosine similarity between features. We further analyze teacher selection strategies (pre- vs. intra-distillation) and introduce a scalable cross-class batch formation scheme for fast parallel synthesis. Code will be released after the review period.
