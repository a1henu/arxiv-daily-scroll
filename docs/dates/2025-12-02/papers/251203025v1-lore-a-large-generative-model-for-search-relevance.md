**一句话要点**：提出LORE框架，通过能力分解与两阶段训练提升电商搜索相关性。

**关键词**：搜索相关性, 大语言模型, 两阶段训练, 能力分解, 电商搜索, RAIR基准

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：现有方法将相关性视为单一任务，导致性能瓶颈。
- 方法要点：将相关性分解为知识推理、多模态匹配和规则遵循能力，采用SFT与RL两阶段训练。
- 实验或效果：在线部署三年，累计提升GoodRate指标27%，并建立RAIR基准评估。

## 摘要（原文）

> Achievement. We introduce LORE, a systematic framework for Large Generative Model-based relevance in e-commerce search. Deployed and iterated over three years, LORE achieves a cumulative +27\% improvement in online GoodRate metrics. This report shares the valuable experience gained throughout its development lifecycle, spanning data, features, training, evaluation, and deployment. Insight. While existing works apply Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to enhance relevance, they often hit a performance ceiling. We argue this stems from treating relevance as a monolithic task, lacking principled deconstruction. Our key insight is that relevance comprises distinct capabilities: knowledge and reasoning, multi-modal matching, and rule adherence. We contend that a qualitative-driven decomposition is essential for breaking through current performance bottlenecks. Contributions. LORE provides a complete blueprint for the LLM relevance lifecycle. Key contributions include: (1) A two-stage training paradigm combining progressive CoT synthesis via SFT with human preference alignment via RL. (2) A comprehensive benchmark, RAIR, designed to evaluate these core capabilities. (3) A query frequency-stratified deployment strategy that efficiently transfers offline LLM capabilities to the online system. LORE serves as both a practical solution and a methodological reference for other vertical domains.
