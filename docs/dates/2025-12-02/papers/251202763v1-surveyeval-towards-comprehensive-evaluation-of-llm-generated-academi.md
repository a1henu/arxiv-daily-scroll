**一句话要点**：提出SurveyEval基准以全面评估LLM生成的学术综述系统

**关键词**：LLM评估, 学术综述生成, 基准测试, 多维度评估, 人机对齐

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：LLM自动生成综述系统的评估方法尚不完善，缺乏标准化基准
- 方法要点：构建SurveyEval基准，从整体质量、大纲连贯性和引用准确性三个维度评估
- 实验或效果：在7个学科上测试，显示专用系统优于通用长文本生成系统，评估结果与人类对齐

## 摘要（原文）

> LLM-based automatic survey systems are transforming how users acquire information from the web by integrating retrieval, organization, and content synthesis into end-to-end generation pipelines. While recent works focus on developing new generation pipelines, how to evaluate such complex systems remains a significant challenge. To this end, we introduce SurveyEval, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates automatically generated surveys across three dimensions: overall quality, outline coherence, and reference accuracy. We extend the evaluation across 7 subjects and augment the LLM-as-a-Judge framework with human references to strengthen evaluation-human alignment. Evaluation results show that while general long-text or paper-writing systems tend to produce lower-quality surveys, specialized survey-generation systems are able to deliver substantially higher-quality results. We envision SurveyEval as a scalable testbed to understand and improve automatic survey systems across diverse subjects and evaluation criteria.
