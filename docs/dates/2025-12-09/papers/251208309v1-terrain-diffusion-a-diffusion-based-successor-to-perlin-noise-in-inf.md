## 摘要（原文）

> For decades, procedural worlds have been built on procedural noise functions such as Perlin noise, which are fast and infinite, yet fundamentally limited in realism and large-scale coherence. We introduce Terrain Diffusion, an AI-era successor to Perlin noise that bridges the fidelity of diffusion models with the properties that made procedural noise indispensable: seamless infinite extent, seed-consistency, and constant-time random access. At its core is InfiniteDiffusion, a novel algorithm for infinite generation, enabling seamless, real-time synthesis of boundless landscapes. A hierarchical stack of diffusion models couples planetary context with local detail, while a compact Laplacian encoding stabilizes outputs across Earth-scale dynamic ranges. An open-source infinite-tensor framework supports constant-memory manipulation of unbounded tensors, and few-step consistency distillation enables efficient generation. Together, these components establish diffusion models as a practical foundation for procedural world generation, capable of synthesizing entire planets coherently, controllably, and without limits.
