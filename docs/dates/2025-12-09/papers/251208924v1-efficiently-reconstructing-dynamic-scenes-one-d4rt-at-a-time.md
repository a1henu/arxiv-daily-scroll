## 摘要（原文）

> Understanding and reconstructing the complex geometry and motion of dynamic scenes from video remains a formidable challenge in computer vision. This paper introduces D4RT, a simple yet powerful feedforward model designed to efficiently solve this task. D4RT utilizes a unified transformer architecture to jointly infer depth, spatio-temporal correspondence, and full camera parameters from a single video. Its core innovation is a novel querying mechanism that sidesteps the heavy computation of dense, per-frame decoding and the complexity of managing multiple, task-specific decoders. Our decoding interface allows the model to independently and flexibly probe the 3D position of any point in space and time. The result is a lightweight and highly scalable method that enables remarkably efficient training and inference. We demonstrate that our approach sets a new state of the art, outperforming previous methods across a wide spectrum of 4D reconstruction tasks.
