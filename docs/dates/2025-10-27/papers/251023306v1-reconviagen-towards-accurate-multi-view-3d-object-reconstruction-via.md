**一句话要点**：提出ReconViaGen以解决多视角3D重建中因遮挡和稀疏覆盖导致的不完整问题

**关键词**：多视角3D重建, 扩散生成模型, 重建先验, 跨视图连接, 迭代去噪控制

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：现有方法依赖视图重叠，但遮挡和稀疏覆盖导致重建不完整，扩散生成方法因随机性限制准确性
- 方法要点：整合重建先验到生成框架，改进跨视图连接提取和迭代去噪可控性
- 实验或效果：实验显示能重建完整且准确的3D模型，全局结构和局部细节与输入一致

## 摘要（原文）

> Existing multi-view 3D object reconstruction methods heavily rely on
> sufficient overlap between input views, where occlusions and sparse coverage in
> practice frequently yield severe reconstruction incompleteness. Recent
> advancements in diffusion-based 3D generative techniques offer the potential to
> address these limitations by leveraging learned generative priors to
> hallucinate invisible parts of objects, thereby generating plausible 3D
> structures. However, the stochastic nature of the inference process limits the
> accuracy and reliability of generation results, preventing existing
> reconstruction frameworks from integrating such 3D generative priors. In this
> work, we comprehensively analyze the reasons why diffusion-based 3D generative
> methods fail to achieve high consistency, including (a) the insufficiency in
> constructing and leveraging cross-view connections when extracting multi-view
> image features as conditions, and (b) the poor controllability of iterative
> denoising during local detail generation, which easily leads to plausible but
> inconsistent fine geometric and texture details with inputs. Accordingly, we
> propose ReconViaGen to innovatively integrate reconstruction priors into the
> generative framework and devise several strategies that effectively address
> these issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReconViaGen can
> reconstruct complete and accurate 3D models consistent with input views in both
> global structure and local details.Project page:
