## 摘要（原文）

> Heavy-duty hydraulic manipulators (HHMs) operate under strict physical and
> safety-critical constraints due to their large size, high power, and complex
> nonlinear dynamics. Ensuring that both joint-level and end-effector
> trajectories remain compliant with actuator capabilities, such as force,
> velocity, and position limits, is essential for safe and reliable operation,
> yet remains largely underexplored in real-time control frameworks. This paper
> presents a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework designed to
> guarantee constraint satisfaction throughout the full nonlinear dynamics of
> HHMs, while running at a real-time control frequency of 1 kHz. The proposed
> method combines a multiple-shooting strategy with real-time sensor feedback,
> and is supported by a robust low-level controller based on virtual
> decomposition control (VDC) for precise joint tracking. Experimental validation
> on a full-scale hydraulic manipulator shows that the NMPC framework not only
> enforces actuator constraints at the joint level, but also ensures
> constraint-compliant motion in Cartesian space for the end-effector. These
> results demonstrate the method's capability to deliver high-accuracy trajectory
> tracking while strictly respecting safety-critical limits, setting a new
> benchmark for real-time control in large-scale hydraulic systems.
