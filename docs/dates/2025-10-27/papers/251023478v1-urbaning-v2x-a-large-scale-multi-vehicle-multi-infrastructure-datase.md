**一句话要点**：提出UrbanIng-V2X数据集以解决多交叉路口协同感知基准缺失问题

**关键词**：协同感知, 多模态数据集, 车辆到一切, 3D目标检测, 城市交叉路口, 数字孪生

## 3 点简述
- 现有协同感知数据集局限于单交叉路口或单车，易导致算法过拟合
- UrbanIng-V2X包含三交叉路口多车辆与基础设施传感器数据，支持多模态感知
- 提供712k 3D标注实例，并基于先进方法进行综合评估与代码发布

## 摘要（原文）

> Recent cooperative perception datasets have played a crucial role in
> advancing smart mobility applications by enabling information exchange between
> intelligent agents, helping to overcome challenges such as occlusions and
> improving overall scene understanding. While some existing real-world datasets
> incorporate both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure interactions,
> they are typically limited to a single intersection or a single vehicle. A
> comprehensive perception dataset featuring multiple connected vehicles and
> infrastructure sensors across several intersections remains unavailable,
> limiting the benchmarking of algorithms in diverse traffic environments.
> Consequently, overfitting can occur, and models may demonstrate misleadingly
> high performance due to similar intersection layouts and traffic participant
> behavior. To address this gap, we introduce UrbanIng-V2X, the first
> large-scale, multi-modal dataset supporting cooperative perception involving
> vehicles and infrastructure sensors deployed across three urban intersections
> in Ingolstadt, Germany. UrbanIng-V2X consists of 34 temporally aligned and
> spatially calibrated sensor sequences, each lasting 20 seconds. All sequences
> contain recordings from one of three intersections, involving two vehicles and
> up to three infrastructure-mounted sensor poles operating in coordinated
> scenarios. In total, UrbanIng-V2X provides data from 12 vehicle-mounted RGB
> cameras, 2 vehicle LiDARs, 17 infrastructure thermal cameras, and 12
> infrastructure LiDARs. All sequences are annotated at a frequency of 10 Hz with
> 3D bounding boxes spanning 13 object classes, resulting in approximately 712k
> annotated instances across the dataset. We provide comprehensive evaluations
> using state-of-the-art cooperative perception methods and publicly release the
> codebase, dataset, HD map, and a digital twin of the complete data collection
> environment.
