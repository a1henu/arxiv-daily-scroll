## 摘要（原文）

> In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, accurate 3D reconstruction from
> endoscopic video is vital for downstream tasks and improved outcomes. However,
> endoscopic scenarios present unique challenges, including photometric
> inconsistencies, non-rigid tissue motion, and view-dependent highlights. Most
> 3DGS-based methods that rely solely on appearance constraints for optimizing
> 3DGS are often insufficient in this context, as these dynamic visual artifacts
> can mislead the optimization process and lead to inaccurate reconstructions. To
> address these limitations, we present EndoWave, a unified spatio-temporal
> Gaussian Splatting framework by incorporating an optical flow-based geometric
> constraint and a multi-resolution rational wavelet supervision. First, we adopt
> a unified spatio-temporal Gaussian representation that directly optimizes
> primitives in a 4D domain. Second, we propose a geometric constraint derived
> from optical flow to enhance temporal coherence and effectively constrain the
> 3D structure of the scene. Third, we propose a multi-resolution rational
> orthogonal wavelet as a constraint, which can effectively separate the details
> of the endoscope and enhance the rendering performance. Extensive evaluations
> on two real surgical datasets, EndoNeRF and StereoMIS, demonstrate that our
> method EndoWave achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and visual
> accuracy compared to the baseline method.
