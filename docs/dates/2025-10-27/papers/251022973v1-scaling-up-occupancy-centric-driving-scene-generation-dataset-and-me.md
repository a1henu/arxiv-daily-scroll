## 摘要（原文）

> Driving scene generation is a critical domain for autonomous driving,
> enabling downstream applications, including perception and planning evaluation.
> Occupancy-centric methods have recently achieved state-of-the-art results by
> offering consistent conditioning across frames and modalities; however, their
> performance heavily depends on annotated occupancy data, which still remains
> scarce. To overcome this limitation, we curate Nuplan-Occ, the largest semantic
> occupancy dataset to date, constructed from the widely used Nuplan benchmark.
> Its scale and diversity facilitate not only large-scale generative modeling but
> also autonomous driving downstream applications. Based on this dataset, we
> develop a unified framework that jointly synthesizes high-quality semantic
> occupancy, multi-view videos, and LiDAR point clouds. Our approach incorporates
> a spatio-temporal disentangled architecture to support high-fidelity spatial
> expansion and temporal forecasting of 4D dynamic occupancy. To bridge modal
> gaps, we further propose two novel techniques: a Gaussian splatting-based
> sparse point map rendering strategy that enhances multi-view video generation,
> and a sensor-aware embedding strategy that explicitly models LiDAR sensor
> properties for realistic multi-LiDAR simulation. Extensive experiments
> demonstrate that our method achieves superior generation fidelity and
> scalability compared to existing approaches, and validates its practical value
> in downstream tasks. Repo:
