## 摘要（原文）

> Robotic arms are increasingly deployed in uncertain environments, yet
> conventional control pipelines often become rigid and brittle when exposed to
> perturbations or incomplete information. Virtual Model Control (VMC) enables
> compliant behaviors by embedding virtual forces and mapping them into joint
> torques, but its reliance on fixed parameters and limited coordination among
> virtual components constrains adaptability and may undermine stability as task
> objectives evolve. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive VMC with
> Large Language Model (LLM)- and Lyapunov-Based Reinforcement Learning (RL),
> which preserves the physical interpretability of VMC while supporting
> stability-guaranteed online adaptation. The LLM provides structured priors and
> high-level reasoning that enhance coordination among virtual components,
> improve sample efficiency, and facilitate flexible adjustment to varying task
> requirements. Complementarily, Lyapunov-based RL enforces theoretical stability
> constraints, ensuring safe and reliable adaptation under uncertainty. Extensive
> simulations on a 7-DoF Panda arm demonstrate that our approach effectively
> balances competing objectives in dynamic tasks, achieving superior performance
> while highlighting the synergistic benefits of LLM guidance and
> Lyapunov-constrained adaptation.
