## 摘要（原文）

> Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enables simultaneous
> localization, environment perception, and data exchange for connected
> autonomous vehicles. However, most existing ISAC designs prioritize sensing
> accuracy and communication throughput, treating all targets uniformly and
> overlooking the impact of critical obstacles on motion efficiency. To overcome
> this limitation, we propose a planning-oriented ISAC (PISAC) framework that
> reduces the sensing uncertainty of planning-bottleneck obstacles and expands
> the safe navigable path for the ego-vehicle, thereby bridging the gap between
> physical-layer optimization and motion-level planning. The core of PISAC lies
> in deriving a closed-form safety bound that explicitly links ISAC transmit
> power to sensing uncertainty, based on the Cram\'er-Rao Bound and occupancy
> inflation principles. Using this model, we formulate a bilevel power allocation
> and motion planning (PAMP) problem, where the inner layer optimizes the ISAC
> beam power distribution and the outer layer computes a collision-free
> trajectory under uncertainty-aware safety constraints. Comprehensive
> simulations in high-fidelity urban driving environments demonstrate that PISAC
> achieves up to 40% higher success rates and over 5% shorter traversal times
> than existing ISAC-based and communication-oriented benchmarks, validating its
> effectiveness in enhancing both safety and efficiency.
