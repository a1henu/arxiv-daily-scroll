## 摘要（原文）

> End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a promising paradigm
> that unifies perception, prediction, and planning into a holistic, data-driven
> framework. However, achieving robustness to varying camera viewpoints, a common
> real-world challenge due to diverse vehicle configurations, remains an open
> problem. In this work, we propose VR-Drive, a novel E2E-AD framework that
> addresses viewpoint generalization by jointly learning 3D scene reconstruction
> as an auxiliary task to enable planning-aware view synthesis. Unlike prior
> scene-specific synthesis approaches, VR-Drive adopts a feed-forward inference
> strategy that supports online training-time augmentation from sparse views
> without additional annotations. To further improve viewpoint consistency, we
> introduce a viewpoint-mixed memory bank that facilitates temporal interaction
> across multiple viewpoints and a viewpoint-consistent distillation strategy
> that transfers knowledge from original to synthesized views. Trained in a fully
> end-to-end manner, VR-Drive effectively mitigates synthesis-induced noise and
> improves planning under viewpoint shifts. In addition, we release a new
> benchmark dataset to evaluate E2E-AD performance under novel camera viewpoints,
> enabling comprehensive analysis. Our results demonstrate that VR-Drive is a
> scalable and robust solution for the real-world deployment of end-to-end
> autonomous driving systems.
