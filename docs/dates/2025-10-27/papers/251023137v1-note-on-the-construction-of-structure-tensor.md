## 摘要（原文）

> This note presents a theoretical discussion of two structure tensor
> constructions: one proposed by Bigun and Granlund 1987, and the other by
> Granlund and Knutsson 1995. At first glance, these approaches may appear quite
> different--the former is implemented by averaging outer products of gradient
> filter responses, while the latter constructs the tensor from weighted outer
> products of tune-in frequency vectors of quadrature filters. We argue that when
> both constructions are viewed through the common lens of Total Least Squares
> (TLS) line fitting to the power spectrum, they can be reconciled to a large
> extent, and additional benefits emerge. From this perspective, the correction
> term introduced in Granlund and Knutsson 1995 becomes unnecessary. Omitting it
> ensures that the resulting tensor remains positive semi-definite, thereby
> simplifying the interpretation of its eigenvalues. Furthermore, this
> interpretation allows fitting more than a single 0rientation to the input by
> reinterpreting quadrature filter responses without relying on a structure
> tensor. It also removes the constraint that responses must originate strictly
> from quadrature filters, allowing the use of alternative filter types and
> non-angular tessellations. These alternatives include Gabor filters--which,
> although not strictly quadrature, are still suitable for structure tensor
> construction--even when they tessellate the spectrum in a Cartesian fashion,
> provided they are sufficiently concentrated.
