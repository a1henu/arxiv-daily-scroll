**一句话要点**：提出MIND特征空间变换和集成策略以提升深度学习形变配准的鲁棒性

**关键词**：深度学习形变配准, 鲁棒性提升, MIND特征空间, 图像配准挑战, 集成策略

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：深度学习形变配准方法泛化能力差，难以处理训练数据分布外的图像对比度和模态
- 方法要点：将图像转换到MIND特征空间后输入模型，并采用特殊集成策略
- 实验或效果：在LUMIR脑配准挑战中验证，显著提升鲁棒性，集成策略带来小幅稳定改进

## 摘要（原文）

> Deep learning based deformable registration methods have become popular in
> recent years. However, their ability to generalize beyond training data
> distribution can be poor, significantly hindering their usability. LUMIR brain
> registration challenge for Learn2Reg 2025 aims to advance the field by
> evaluating the performance of the registration on contrasts and modalities
> different from those included in the training set. Here we describe our
> submission to the challenge, which proposes a very simple idea for
> significantly improving robustness by transforming the images into MIND feature
> space before feeding them into the model. In addition, a special ensembling
> strategy is proposed that shows a small but consistent improvement.
