## 摘要（原文）

> Enabling robots to dexterously grasp and manipulate objects based on human
> commands is a promising direction in robotics. However, existing approaches are
> challenging to generalize across diverse objects or tasks due to the limited
> scale of semantic dexterous grasp datasets. Foundation models offer a new way
> to enhance generalization, yet directly leveraging them to generate feasible
> robotic actions remains challenging due to the gap between abstract model
> knowledge and physical robot execution. To address these challenges, we propose
> OmniDexGrasp, a generalizable framework that achieves omni-capabilities in user
> prompting, dexterous embodiment, and grasping tasks by combining foundation
> models with the transfer and control strategies. OmniDexGrasp integrates three
> key modules: (i) foundation models are used to enhance generalization by
> generating human grasp images supporting omni-capability of user prompt and
> task; (ii) a human-image-to-robot-action transfer strategy converts human
> demonstrations into executable robot actions, enabling omni dexterous
> embodiment; (iii) force-aware adaptive grasp strategy ensures robust and stable
> grasp execution. Experiments in simulation and on real robots validate the
> effectiveness of OmniDexGrasp on diverse user prompts, grasp task and dexterous
> hands, and further results show its extensibility to dexterous manipulation
> tasks.
