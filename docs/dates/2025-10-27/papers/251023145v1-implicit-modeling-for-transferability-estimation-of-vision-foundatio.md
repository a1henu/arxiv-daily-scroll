## 摘要（原文）

> Transferability estimation identifies the best pre-trained models for
> downstream tasks without incurring the high computational cost of full
> fine-tuning. This capability facilitates deployment and advances the
> pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. However, existing methods often struggle
> to accurately assess transferability for emerging pre-trained models with
> diverse architectures, training strategies, and task alignments. In this work,
> we propose Implicit Transferability Modeling (ITM), a novel framework that
> implicitly models each model's intrinsic transferability, coupled with a
> Divide-and-Conquer Variational Approximation (DVA) strategy to efficiently
> approximate embedding space evolution. This design enables generalization
> across a broader range of models and downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on
> a comprehensive benchmark--spanning extensive training regimes and a wider
> variety of model types--demonstrate that ITM consistently outperforms existing
> methods in terms of stability, effectiveness, and efficiency.
