## 摘要（原文）

> Low-light vision remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision due to
> severe illumination degradation, which significantly affects the performance of
> downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation. While recent
> state-of-the-art methods have improved performance through invariant feature
> learning modules, they still fall short due to incomplete modeling of low-light
> conditions. Therefore, we revisit low-light image formation and extend the
> classical Lambertian model to better characterize low-light conditions. By
> shifting our analysis to the frequency domain, we theoretically prove that the
> frequency-domain channel ratio can be leveraged to extract
> illumination-invariant features via a structured filtering process. We then
> propose a novel and end-to-end trainable module named \textbf{F}requency-domain
> \textbf{R}adial \textbf{B}asis \textbf{Net}work (\textbf{FRBNet}), which
> integrates the frequency-domain channel ratio operation with a learnable
> frequency domain filter for the overall illumination-invariant feature
> enhancement. As a plug-and-play module, FRBNet can be integrated into existing
> networks for low-light downstream tasks without modifying loss functions.
> Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks demonstrate that FRBNet
> achieves superior performance, including +2.2 mAP for dark object detection and
> +2.9 mIoU for nighttime segmentation. Code is available at:
