**一句话要点**：提出可切换令牌特定码本量化方法以提升人脸图像压缩性能

**关键词**：人脸图像压缩, 码本量化, 令牌特定码本, 图像重构, 低比特率压缩

## 3 点简述
- 人脸图像压缩中全局码本忽略类别相关性和令牌语义差异，导致低比特率性能不佳
- 方法为不同图像类别学习码本组，并为每个令牌分配独立码本，减少码本大小损失
- 在0.05 bpp下重构图像平均识别准确率达93.51%，可集成现有码本方法

## 摘要（原文）

> With the ever-increasing volume of visual data, the efficient and lossless
> transmission, along with its subsequent interpretation and understanding, has
> become a critical bottleneck in modern information systems. The emerged
> codebook-based solution utilize a globally shared codebook to quantize and
> dequantize each token, controlling the bpp by adjusting the number of tokens or
> the codebook size. However, for facial images, which are rich in attributes,
> such global codebook strategies overlook both the category-specific
> correlations within images and the semantic differences among tokens, resulting
> in suboptimal performance, especially at low bpp. Motivated by these
> observations, we propose a Switchable Token-Specific Codebook Quantization for
> face image compression, which learns distinct codebook groups for different
> image categories and assigns an independent codebook to each token. By
> recording the codebook group to which each token belongs with a small number of
> bits, our method can reduce the loss incurred when decreasing the size of each
> codebook group. This enables a larger total number of codebooks under a lower
> overall bpp, thereby enhancing the expressive capability and improving
> reconstruction performance. Owing to its generalizable design, our method can
> be integrated into any existing codebook-based representation learning approach
> and has demonstrated its effectiveness on face recognition datasets, achieving
> an average accuracy of 93.51% for reconstructed images at 0.05 bpp.
