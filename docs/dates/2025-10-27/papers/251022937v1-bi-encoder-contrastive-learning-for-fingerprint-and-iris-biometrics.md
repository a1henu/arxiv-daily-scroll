**arXiv**：[2510.22937v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22937) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22937.pdf)  
**作者**：Matthew So, Judah Goldfeder, Mark Lis, Hod Lipson  

**一句话要点**：提出双编码器对比学习以验证指纹和虹膜生物特征相关性

**关键词**：双编码器网络, 对比学习, 生物特征验证, 指纹匹配, 虹膜匹配, 跨模态匹配

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：测试个体生物特征统计独立性的历史假设
- 方法要点：使用ResNet-50和Vision Transformer训练双编码器，最小化同个体图像对比损失
- 实验或效果：虹膜匹配ROC AUC达91%，指纹结果与先前一致，跨模态匹配接近随机

## 摘要（原文）

> There has been a historic assumption that the biometrics of an individual are
> statistically uncorrelated. We test this assumption by training Bi-Encoder
> networks on three verification tasks, including fingerprint-to-fingerprint
> matching, iris-to-iris matching, and cross-modal fingerprint-to-iris matching
> using 274 subjects with $\sim$100k fingerprints and 7k iris images. We trained
> ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer backbones in Bi-Encoder architectures such
> that the contrastive loss between images sampled from the same individual is
> minimized. The iris ResNet architecture reaches 91 ROC AUC score for
> iris-to-iris matching, providing clear evidence that the left and right irises
> of an individual are correlated. Fingerprint models reproduce the positive
> intra-subject suggested by prior work in this space. This is the first work
> attempting to use Vision Transformers for this matching. Cross-modal matching
> rises only slightly above chance, which suggests that more data and a more
> sophisticated pipeline is needed to obtain compelling results. These findings
> continue challenge independence assumptions of biometrics and we plan to extend
> this work to other biometrics in the future. Code available:
