## 摘要（原文）

> The deployment of mobile robots for material handling in industrial
> environments requires scalable coordination of large fleets in dynamic
> settings. This paper presents a two-layer framework that combines high-level
> scheduling with low-level control. Tasks are assigned and scheduled using the
> compositional algorithm ComSat, which generates time-parameterized routes for
> each robot. These schedules are then used by a distributed Model Predictive
> Control (MPC) system in real time to compute local reference trajectories,
> accounting for static and dynamic obstacles. The approach ensures safe,
> collision-free operation, and supports rapid rescheduling in response to
> disruptions such as robot failures or environmental changes. We evaluate the
> method in simulated 2D environments with varying road capacities and traffic
> conditions, demonstrating high task completion rates and robust behavior even
> under congestion. The modular structure of the framework allows for
> computational tractability and flexibility, making it suitable for deployment
> in complex, real-world industrial scenarios.
