## 摘要（原文）

> Film set design plays a pivotal role in cinematic storytelling and shaping the visual atmosphere. However, the traditional process depends on expert-driven manual modeling, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we introduce FilmSceneDesigner, an automated scene generation system that emulates professional film set design workflow. Given a natural language description, including scene type, historical period, and style, we design an agent-based chaining framework to generate structured parameters aligned with film set design workflow, guided by prompt strategies that ensure parameter accuracy and coherence. On the other hand, we propose a procedural generation pipeline which executes a series of dedicated functions with the structured parameters for floorplan and structure generation, material assignment, door and window placement, and object retrieval and layout, ultimately constructing a complete film scene from scratch. Moreover, to enhance cinematic realism and asset diversity, we construct SetDepot-Pro, a curated dataset of 6,862 film-specific 3D assets and 733 materials. Experimental results and human evaluations demonstrate that our system produces structurally sound scenes with strong cinematic fidelity, supporting downstream tasks such as virtual previs, construction drawing and mood board creation.
