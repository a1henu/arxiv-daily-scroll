**一句话要点**：提出Ref-SAM3D以解决SAM3D无法基于文本描述重建特定3D对象的问题

**关键词**：3D重建, 文本引导, 零样本学习, 单视图重建, SAM3D扩展

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：SAM3D缺乏基于文本描述重建特定3D对象的能力，限制实际应用
- 方法要点：扩展SAM3D，引入文本描述作为先验，实现单RGB图像的文本引导3D重建
- 实验或效果：零样本重建性能竞争且高保真，仅需自然语言和单2D视图

## 摘要（原文）

> SAM3D has garnered widespread attention for its strong 3D object reconstruction capabilities. However, a key limitation remains: SAM3D cannot reconstruct specific objects referred to by textual descriptions, a capability that is essential for practical applications such as 3D editing, game development, and virtual environments. To address this gap, we introduce Ref-SAM3D, a simple yet effective extension to SAM3D that incorporates textual descriptions as a high-level prior, enabling text-guided 3D reconstruction from a single RGB image. Through extensive qualitative experiments, we show that Ref-SAM3D, guided only by natural language and a single 2D view, delivers competitive and high-fidelity zero-shot reconstruction performance. Our results demonstrate that Ref-SAM3D effectively bridges the gap between 2D visual cues and 3D geometric understanding, offering a more flexible and accessible paradigm for reference-guided 3D reconstruction.
