## 摘要（原文）

> Existing industrial 3D garment meshes already cover most real-world clothing geometries, yet their texture diversity remains limited. To acquire more realistic textures, generative methods are often used to extract Physically-based Rendering (PBR) textures and materials from large collections of wild images and project them back onto garment meshes. However, most image-conditioned texture generation approaches require strict topological consistency between the input image and the input 3D mesh, or rely on accurate mesh deformation to match to the image poses, which significantly constrains the texture generation quality and flexibility. To address the challenging problem of non-isometric image-based garment texture generation, we construct 3D Garment Videos, a physically simulated, garment-centric dataset that provides consistent geometry and material supervision across diverse deformations, enabling robust cross-pose texture learning. We further employ Nano Banana for high-quality non-isometric image editing, achieving reliable cross-topology texture generation between non-isometric image-geometry pairs. Finally, we propose an iterative baking method via uncertainty-guided view selection and reweighting that fuses multi-view predictions into seamless, production-ready PBR textures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our feedforward dual-branch architecture generates versatile and spatially aligned PBR materials suitable for industry-level 3D garment design.
