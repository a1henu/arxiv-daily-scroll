**一句话要点**：提出DIQ-H基准以评估视觉语言模型在时序视觉退化下的幻觉持续性

**关键词**：视觉语言模型, 时序视觉退化, 幻觉持续性, 基准评估, 鲁棒性测试, 多轮问答

## 3 点简述
- 现有基准忽略时序退化与错误传播，导致VLM在安全关键应用中存在关键失效模式
- DIQ-H应用基于物理的视觉退化，通过多轮问答任务评估幻觉持续性、错误恢复和时序一致性
- 实验显示16个先进VLM存在显著鲁棒性差距，GPT-4o恢复率仅78.5%，开源模型时序一致性低于60%

## 摘要（原文）

> Vision-Language Models (VLMs) deployed in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving must handle continuous visual streams under imperfect conditions. However, existing benchmarks focus on static, high-quality images and ignore temporal degradation and error propagation, which are critical failure modes where transient visual corruption induces hallucinations that persist across subsequent frames. We introduce DIQ-H, the first benchmark for evaluating VLM robustness under dynamic visual degradation in temporal sequences. DIQ-H applies physics-based corruptions including motion blur, sensor noise, and compression artifacts, and measures hallucination persistence, error recovery, and temporal consistency through multi-turn question-answering tasks. To enable scalable annotation, we propose Uncertainty-Guided Iterative Refinement (UIR), which generates reliable pseudo-ground-truth using lightweight VLMs with uncertainty filtering, achieving a 15.3 percent accuracy improvement. Experiments on 16 state-of-the-art VLMs reveal substantial robustness gaps: even advanced models such as GPT-4o achieve only a 78.5 percent recovery rate, while open-source models struggle with temporal consistency at less than 60 percent. DIQ-H provides a comprehensive platform for evaluating VLM reliability in real-world deployments.
