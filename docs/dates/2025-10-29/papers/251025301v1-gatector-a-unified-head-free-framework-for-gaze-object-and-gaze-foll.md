## 摘要（原文）

> Gaze object detection and gaze following are fundamental tasks for
> interpreting human gaze behavior or intent. However, most previous methods
> usually solve these two tasks separately, and their prediction of gaze objects
> and gaze following typically depend on head-related prior knowledge during both
> the training phase and real-world deployment. This dependency necessitates an
> auxiliary network to extract head location, thus precluding joint optimization
> across the entire system and constraining the practical applicability. To this
> end, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and
> gaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors
> during inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded
> specific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone,
> which extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using
> the shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared
> backbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain
> head-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head
> detection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing
> the gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense
> feature and gaze feature with the help of head location. Since the
> suboptimization of the gaze point heatmap leads to the performance bottleneck,
> we propose an attention supervision mechanism to accelerate the learning of the
> gaze heatmap. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, mean Similarity
> over Candidates (mSoC), for gaze object detection, which is more sensitive to
> variations between bounding boxes. The experimental results on multiple
> benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both gaze
> object detection and gaze following tasks.
