## 摘要（原文）

> Real-time object detection has achieved substantial progress through
> meticulously designed architectures and optimization strategies. However, the
> pursuit of high-speed inference via lightweight network designs often leads to
> degraded feature representation, which hinders further performance improvements
> and practical on-device deployment. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective
> and highly adaptable distillation framework that harnesses the rapidly evolving
> capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance lightweight object
> detectors. Given the significant architectural and learning objective
> disparities between VFMs and resource-constrained detectors, achieving stable
> and task-aligned semantic transfer is challenging. To address this, on one
> hand, we introduce a Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) module that facilitates the
> integration of high-level representations from VFMs into the deep layers of the
> detector. On the other hand, we devise a Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation
> (GAM) strategy, which dynamically adjusts the intensity of semantic transfer
> based on gradient norm ratios. Without increasing deployment and inference
> overhead, our approach painlessly delivers striking and consistent performance
> gains across diverse DETR-based models, underscoring its practical utility for
> real-time detection. Our new model family, RT-DETRv4, achieves state-of-the-art
> results on COCO, attaining AP scores of 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 at corresponding
> speeds of 273/169/124/78 FPS.
