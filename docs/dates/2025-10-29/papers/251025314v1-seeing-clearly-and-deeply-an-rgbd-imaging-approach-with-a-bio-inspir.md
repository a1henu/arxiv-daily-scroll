## 摘要（原文）

> Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge:
> conventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire
> depth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an
> ill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with
> elements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication
> complexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this,
> we first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around
> which we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic
> co-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying
> Point Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform
> elements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a
> synthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This
> simulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction
> network that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity
> All-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture.
> Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed
> framework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an
> RMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and
> other deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM
> of 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior
> balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that
> the integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint
> reconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the
> intrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging. Source code will
> be publicly available at https://github.com/ZongxiYu-ZJU/BMI.
