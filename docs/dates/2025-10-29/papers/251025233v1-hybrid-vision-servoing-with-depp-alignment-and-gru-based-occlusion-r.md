**一句话要点**：提出混合视觉跟踪框架以解决机器人视觉伺服中的遮挡问题

**关键词**：视觉伺服, 遮挡恢复, 深度学习跟踪, 机器人视觉, 实时控制

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：视觉伺服在部分或完全遮挡下难以保持鲁棒目标跟踪
- 方法要点：结合全局模板匹配、深度特征Lucas-Kanade和GRU预测器实现实时跟踪
- 实验或效果：在高达90%遮挡的手持视频序列中，跟踪误差低于2像素

## 摘要（原文）

> Vision-based control systems, such as image-based visual servoing (IBVS),
> have been extensively explored for precise robot manipulation. A persistent
> challenge, however, is maintaining robust target tracking under partial or full
> occlusions. Classical methods like Lucas-Kanade (LK) offer lightweight tracking
> but are fragile to occlusion and drift, while deep learning-based approaches
> often require continuous visibility and intensive computation. To address these
> gaps, we propose a hybrid visual tracking framework that bridges advanced
> perception with real-time servo control. First, a fast global template matcher
> constrains the pose search region; next, a deep-feature Lucas-Kanade module
> operating on early VGG layers refines alignment to sub-pixel accuracy (<2px);
> then, a lightweight residual regressor corrects local misalignments caused by
> texture degradation or partial occlusion. When visual confidence falls below a
> threshold, a GRU-based predictor seamlessly extrapolates pose updates from
> recent motion history. Crucially, the pipeline's final outputs-translation,
> rotation, and scale deltas-are packaged as direct control signals for 30Hz
> image-based servo loops. Evaluated on handheld video sequences with up to 90%
> occlusion, our system sustains under 2px tracking error, demonstrating the
> robustness and low-latency precision essential for reliable real-world robot
> vision applications.
