## 摘要（原文）

> In this paper a new method for geometric robot calibration is introduced,
> which uses a calibration plate with precisely known distances between its
> measuring points. The relative measurement between two points on the
> calibration plate is used to determine predefined error parameters of the
> system. In comparison to conventional measurement methods, like laser tracker
> or motion capture systems, the calibration plate provides a more mechanically
> robust and cheaper alternative, which is furthermore easier to transport due to
> its small size. The calibration method, the plate design, the mathematical
> description of the error system as well as the identification of the parameters
> are described in detail. For identifying the error parameters, the least
> squares method and a constrained optimization problem are used. The
> functionality of this method was demonstrated in experiments that led to
> promising results, correlated with one of a laser tracker calibration. The
> modeling and identification of the error parameters is done for a gantry
> machine, but is not restricted to that type of robot.
