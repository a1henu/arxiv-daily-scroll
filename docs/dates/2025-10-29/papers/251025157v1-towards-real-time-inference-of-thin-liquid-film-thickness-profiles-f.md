## 摘要（原文）

> Thin film interferometry is a powerful technique for non-invasively measuring
> liquid film thickness with applications in ophthalmology, but its clinical
> translation is hindered by the challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles
> from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase
> periodicity, imaging noise and ambient artifacts. Traditional reconstruction
> methods are either computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, or require
> manual expert analysis, which is impractical for real-time diagnostics. To
> address this challenge, here we present a vision transformer-based approach for
> real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles directly from
> isolated interferograms. Trained on a hybrid dataset combining
> physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data, our model
> leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and
> reconstruct temporally coherent thickness profiles in a single forward pass
> from dynamic interferograms acquired in vivo and ex vivo. The network
> demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with
> motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and
> iterative fitting methods. Our data-driven approach enables automated,
> consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware,
> opening new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear
> films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as the dry eye disease.
