## 摘要（原文）

> Expressions are fundamental to conveying human emotions. With the rapid
> advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC), realistic and expressive 3D facial
> animation has become increasingly crucial. Despite recent progress in
> speech-driven lip-sync for talking-face animation, generating emotionally
> expressive talking faces remains underexplored. A major obstacle is the
> scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to the high cost of
> data capture. To address this, we model facial animation driven by both speech
> and emotion as a linear additive problem. Leveraging a 3D talking-face dataset
> with neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a dataset of 3D expression sequences
> (Florence4D), we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and
> emotion. We introduce a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement
> between the two types of blendshapes while allowing the model to capture
> inherent secondary cross-domain deformations present in the training data. The
> learned blendshapes can be further mapped to the expression and jaw pose
> parameters of the FLAME model, enabling the animation of 3D Gaussian avatars.
> Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method naturally
> generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate
> lip synchronization. Perceptual studies further show that our approach achieves
> superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods, without
> compromising lip-sync quality.
