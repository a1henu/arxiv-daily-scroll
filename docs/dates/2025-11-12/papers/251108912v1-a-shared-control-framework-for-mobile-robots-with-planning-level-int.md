## 摘要（原文）

> In mobile robot shared control, effectively understanding human motion intention is critical for seamless human-robot collaboration. This paper presents a novel shared control framework featuring planning-level intention prediction. A path replanning algorithm is designed to adjust the robot's desired trajectory according to inferred human intentions. To represent future motion intentions, we introduce the concept of an intention domain, which serves as a constraint for path replanning. The intention-domain prediction and path replanning problems are jointly formulated as a Markov Decision Process and solved through deep reinforcement learning. In addition, a Voronoi-based human trajectory generation algorithm is developed, allowing the model to be trained entirely in simulation without human participation or demonstration data. Extensive simulations and real-world user studies demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces operator workload and enhances safety, without compromising task efficiency compared with existing assistive teleoperation approaches.
