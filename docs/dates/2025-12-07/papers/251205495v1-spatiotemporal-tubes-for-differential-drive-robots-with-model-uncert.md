## 摘要（原文）

> This paper presents a Spatiotemporal Tube (STT)-based control framework for differential-drive mobile robots with dynamic uncertainties and external disturbances, guaranteeing the satisfaction of Temporal Reach-Avoid-Stay (T-RAS) specifications. The approach employs circular STT, characterized by smoothly time-varying center and radius, to define dynamic safe corridors that guide the robot from the start region to the goal while avoiding obstacles. In particular, we first develop a sampling-based synthesis algorithm to construct a feasible STT that satisfies the prescribed timing and safety constraints with formal guarantees. To ensure that the robot remains confined within this tube, we then design analytically a closed-form, approximation-free control law. The resulting controller is computationally efficient, robust to disturbances and {model uncertainties}, and requires no model approximations or online optimization. The proposed framework is validated through simulation studies on a differential-drive robot and benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness, accuracy, and computational efficiency.
