## 摘要（原文）

> CoNi-MPC provides an efficient framework for UAV control in air-ground
> cooperative tasks by relying exclusively on relative states, eliminating the
> need for global state estimation. However, its lack of environmental
> information poses significant challenges for obstacle avoidance. To address
> this issue, we propose a novel obstacle avoidance algorithm, Cooperative
> Non-inertial frame-based Obstacle Avoidance (CoNi-OA), designed explicitly for
> UAV-UGV cooperative scenarios without reliance on global state estimation or
> obstacle prediction. CoNi-OA uniquely utilizes a single frame of raw LiDAR data
> from the UAV to generate a modulation matrix, which directly adjusts the
> quadrotor's velocity to achieve obstacle avoidance. This modulation-based
> method enables real-time generation of collision-free trajectories within the
> UGV's non-inertial frame, significantly reducing computational demands (less
> than 5 ms per iteration) while maintaining safety in dynamic and unpredictable
> environments. The key contributions of this work include: (1) a
> modulation-based obstacle avoidance algorithm specifically tailored for UAV-UGV
> cooperation in non-inertial frames without global states; (2) rapid, real-time
> trajectory generation based solely on single-frame LiDAR data, removing the
> need for obstacle modeling or prediction; and (3) adaptability to both static
> and dynamic environments, thus extending applicability to featureless or
> unknown scenarios.
