**作者**：Alejandro Escontrela, Shrinu Kushagra, Sjoerd van Steenkiste, Yulia Rubanova, Aleksander Holynski, Kelsey Allen, Kevin Murphy, Thomas Kipf  

**一句话要点**：提出Neural USD框架以解决生成模型中精确迭代对象编辑的挑战

**关键词**：可控生成模型, 对象编辑, 分层表示, 解耦控制, 迭代工作流程

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：当前可控生成模型在对象编辑时易导致场景全局意外变化
- 方法要点：采用分层结构化表示场景和对象，支持外观、几何和姿态的独立控制
- 实验或效果：评估设计选项，展示框架支持迭代增量工作流程

## 摘要（原文）

> Amazing progress has been made in controllable generative modeling,
> especially over the last few years. However, some challenges remain. One of
> them is precise and iterative object editing. In many of the current methods,
> trying to edit the generated image (for example, changing the color of a
> particular object in the scene or changing the background while keeping other
> elements unchanged) by changing the conditioning signals often leads to
> unintended global changes in the scene. In this work, we take the first steps
> to address the above challenges. Taking inspiration from the Universal Scene
> Descriptor (USD) standard developed in the computer graphics community, we
> introduce the "Neural Universal Scene Descriptor" or Neural USD. In this
> framework, we represent scenes and objects in a structured, hierarchical
> manner. This accommodates diverse signals, minimizes model-specific
> constraints, and enables per-object control over appearance, geometry, and
> pose. We further apply a fine-tuning approach which ensures that the above
> control signals are disentangled from one another. We evaluate several design
> considerations for our framework, demonstrating how Neural USD enables
> iterative and incremental workflows. More information at:
