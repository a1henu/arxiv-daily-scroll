## 摘要（原文）

> Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate strong generalization
> in zero-shot classification but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial
> perturbations. Existing methods primarily focus on adversarial fine-tuning or
> prompt optimization; they often overlook the gaps in CLIP's encoded features,
> which is shown as the text and image features lie far apart from each other.
> This misalignment is significantly amplified under adversarial perturbations,
> leading to severe degradation in classification performance. To address this
> problem, we propose Cross-modality Alignment, dubbed COLA, an optimal
> transport-based framework that explicitly addresses adversarial misalignment by
> restoring both global image-text alignment and local structural consistency in
> the feature space. (1) COLA first projects adversarial image embeddings onto a
> subspace spanned by class text features, effectively filtering out non-semantic
> distortions while preserving discriminative information. (2) It then models
> images and texts as discrete distributions over multiple augmented views and
> refines their alignment via OT, with the subspace projection seamlessly
> integrated into the cost computation. This design ensures stable cross-modal
> alignment even under adversarial conditions. COLA is training-free and
> compatible with existing fine-tuned models. Extensive evaluations across 14
> zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of COLA,
> especially with an average improvement of 6.7% on ImageNet and its variants
> under PGD adversarial attacks, while maintaining high accuracy on clean
> samples.
