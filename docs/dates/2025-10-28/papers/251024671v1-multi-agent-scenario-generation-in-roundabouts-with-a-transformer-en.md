## 摘要（原文）

> With the increasing integration of intelligent driving functions into
> serial-produced vehicles, ensuring their functionality and robustness poses
> greater challenges. Compared to traditional road testing, scenario-based
> virtual testing offers significant advantages in terms of time and cost
> efficiency, reproducibility, and exploration of edge cases. We propose a
> Transformer-enhanced Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE-T) model for
> generating multi-agent traffic scenarios in roundabouts, which are
> characterized by high vehicle dynamics and complex layouts, yet remain
> relatively underexplored in current research. The results show that the
> proposed model can accurately reconstruct original scenarios and generate
> realistic, diverse synthetic scenarios. Besides, two Key-Performance-Indicators
> (KPIs) are employed to evaluate the interactive behavior in the generated
> scenarios. Analysis of the latent space reveals partial disentanglement, with
> several latent dimensions exhibiting distinct and interpretable effects on
> scenario attributes such as vehicle entry timing, exit timing, and velocity
> profiles. The results demonstrate the model's capability to generate scenarios
> for the validation of intelligent driving functions involving multi-agent
> interactions, as well as to augment data for their development and iterative
> improvement.
