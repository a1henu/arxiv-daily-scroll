## 摘要（原文）

> Accurate polyp and cardiac segmentation for early detection and treatment is
> essential for the diagnosis and treatment planning of cancer-like diseases.
> Traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) based models have represented
> limited generalizability, robustness, and inability to handle uncertainty,
> which affects the segmentation performance. To solve these problems, this paper
> introduces CLFSeg, an encoder-decoder based framework that aggregates the
> Fuzzy-Convolutional (FC) module leveraging convolutional layers and fuzzy
> logic. This module enhances the segmentation performance by identifying local
> and global features while minimizing the uncertainty, noise, and ambiguity in
> boundary regions, ensuring computing efficiency. In order to handle class
> imbalance problem while focusing on the areas of interest with tiny and
> boundary regions, binary cross-entropy (BCE) with dice loss is incorporated.
> Our proposed model exhibits exceptional performance on four publicly available
> datasets, including CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, EtisLaribPolypDB, and ACDC.
> Extensive experiments and visual studies show CLFSeg surpasses the existing
> SOTA performance and focuses on relevant regions of interest in anatomical
> structures. The proposed CLFSeg improves performance while ensuring computing
> efficiency, which makes it a potential solution for real-world medical
> diagnostic scenarios. Project page is available at
