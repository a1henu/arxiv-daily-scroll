## 摘要（原文）

> Infrastructure-based perception plays a crucial role in intelligent
> transportation systems, offering global situational awareness and enabling
> cooperative autonomy. However, existing camera-based detection models often
> underperform in such scenarios due to challenges such as multi-view
> infrastructure setup, diverse camera configurations, degraded visual inputs,
> and various road layouts. We introduce MIC-BEV, a Transformer-based
> bird's-eye-view (BEV) perception framework for infrastructure-based
> multi-camera 3D object detection. MIC-BEV flexibly supports a variable number
> of cameras with heterogeneous intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and
> demonstrates strong robustness under sensor degradation. The proposed
> graph-enhanced fusion module in MIC-BEV integrates multi-view image features
> into the BEV space by exploiting geometric relationships between cameras and
> BEV cells alongside latent visual cues. To support training and evaluation, we
> introduce M2I, a synthetic dataset for infrastructure-based object detection,
> featuring diverse camera configurations, road layouts, and environmental
> conditions. Extensive experiments on both M2I and the real-world dataset
> RoScenes demonstrate that MIC-BEV achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D
> object detection. It also remains robust under challenging conditions,
> including extreme weather and sensor degradation. These results highlight the
> potential of MIC-BEV for real-world deployment. The dataset and source code are
> available at: https://github.com/HandsomeYun/MIC-BEV.
