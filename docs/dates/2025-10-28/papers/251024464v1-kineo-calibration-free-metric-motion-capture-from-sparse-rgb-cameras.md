## 摘要（原文）

> Markerless multiview motion capture is often constrained by the need for
> precise camera calibration, limiting accessibility for non-experts and
> in-the-wild captures. Existing calibration-free approaches mitigate this
> requirement but suffer from high computational cost and reduced reconstruction
> accuracy.
>   We present Kineo, a fully automatic, calibration-free pipeline for markerless
> motion capture from videos captured by unsynchronized, uncalibrated,
> consumer-grade RGB cameras. Kineo leverages 2D keypoints from off-the-shelf
> detectors to simultaneously calibrate cameras, including Brown-Conrady
> distortion coefficients, and reconstruct 3D keypoints and dense scene point
> maps at metric scale. A confidence-driven spatio-temporal keypoint sampling
> strategy, combined with graph-based global optimization, ensures robust
> calibration at a fixed computational cost independent of sequence length. We
> further introduce a pairwise reprojection consensus score to quantify 3D
> reconstruction reliability for downstream tasks.
>   Evaluations on EgoHumans and Human3.6M demonstrate substantial improvements
> over prior calibration-free methods. Compared to previous state-of-the-art
> approaches, Kineo reduces camera translation error by approximately 83-85%,
> camera angular error by 86-92%, and world mean-per-joint error (W-MPJPE) by
> 83-91%.
>   Kineo is also efficient in real-world scenarios, processing multi-view
> sequences faster than their duration in specific configuration (e.g., 36min to
> process 1h20min of footage). The full pipeline and evaluation code are openly
> released to promote reproducibility and practical adoption at
> https://liris-xr.github.io/kineo/.
