## 摘要（原文）

> To generate reliable motion for legged robots through trajectory
> optimization, it is crucial to simultaneously compute the robot's path and
> contact sequence, as well as accurately consider the dynamics in the problem
> formulation. In this paper, we present a phase-based trajectory optimization
> that ensures the feasibility of translational dynamics and friction cone
> constraints throughout the entire trajectory. Specifically, our approach
> leverages the superposition properties of linear differential equations to
> decouple the translational dynamics for each contact point, which operates
> under different phase sequences. Furthermore, we utilize the differentiation
> matrix of B{\'e}zier polynomials to derive an analytical relationship between
> the robot's position and force, thereby ensuring the consistent satisfaction of
> translational dynamics. Additionally, by exploiting the convex closure property
> of B{\'e}zier polynomials, our method ensures compliance with friction cone
> constraints. Using the aforementioned approach, the proposed trajectory
> optimization framework can generate dynamically reliable motions with various
> gait sequences for legged robots. We validate our framework using a quadruped
> robot model, focusing on the feasibility of dynamics and motion generation.
