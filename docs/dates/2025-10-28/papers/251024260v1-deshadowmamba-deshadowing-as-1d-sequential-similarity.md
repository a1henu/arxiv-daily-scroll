## 摘要（原文）

> Recent deep models for image shadow removal often rely on attention-based
> architectures to capture long-range dependencies. However, their fixed
> attention patterns tend to mix illumination cues from irrelevant regions,
> leading to distorted structures and inconsistent colors. In this work, we
> revisit shadow removal from a sequence modeling perspective and explore the use
> of Mamba, a selective state space model that propagates global context through
> directional state transitions. These transitions yield an efficient global
> receptive field while preserving positional continuity. Despite its potential,
> directly applying Mamba to image data is suboptimal, since it lacks awareness
> of shadow-non-shadow semantics and remains susceptible to color interference
> from nearby regions. To address these limitations, we propose CrossGate, a
> directional modulation mechanism that injects shadow-aware similarity into
> Mamba's input gate, allowing selective integration of relevant context along
> transition axes. To further ensure appearance fidelity, we introduce ColorShift
> regularization, a contrastive learning objective driven by global color
> statistics. By synthesizing structured informative negatives, it guides the
> model to suppress color contamination and achieve robust color restoration.
> Together, these components adapt sequence modeling to the structural integrity
> and chromatic consistency required for shadow removal. Extensive experiments on
> public benchmarks demonstrate that DeshadowMamba achieves state-of-the-art
> visual quality and strong quantitative performance.
