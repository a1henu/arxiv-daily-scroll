**关键词**：空气污染预测, 神经网络模型, 极端事件处理, Transformer架构, 扩散模型, PM浓度预测

## 3 点简述
- 现有模型常低估罕见但危险的空气污染事件，如野火和沙尘暴。
- 基于Transformer和扩散随机细化模块，捕捉PM浓度的非线性动态。
- 使用ERA5和CAMS数据，在多种PM变量上显著提升预测准确性。

## 摘要（原文）

> Air pollution remains a leading global health and environmental risk,
> particularly in regions vulnerable to episodic air pollution spikes due to
> wildfires, urban haze and dust storms. Accurate forecasting of particulate
> matter (PM) concentrations is essential to enable timely public health warnings
> and interventions, yet existing models often underestimate rare but hazardous
> pollution events. Here, we present SynCast, a high-resolution neural
> forecasting model that integrates meteorological and air composition data to
> improve predictions of both average and extreme pollution levels. Built on a
> regionally adapted transformer backbone and enhanced with a diffusion-based
> stochastic refinement module, SynCast captures the nonlinear dynamics driving
> PM spikes more accurately than existing approaches. Leveraging on harmonized
> ERA5 and CAMS datasets, our model shows substantial gains in forecasting
> fidelity across multiple PM variables (PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, PM$_{10}$),
> especially under extreme conditions. We demonstrate that conventional loss
> functions underrepresent distributional tails (rare pollution events) and show
> that SynCast, guided by domain-aware objectives and extreme value theory,
> significantly enhances performance in highly impacted regions without
> compromising global accuracy. This approach provides a scalable foundation for
> next-generation air quality early warning systems and supports climate-health
> risk mitigation in vulnerable regions.
