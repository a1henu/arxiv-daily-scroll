## 摘要（原文）

> To improve detection robustness in adverse conditions (e.g., haze and low
> light), image restoration is commonly applied as a pre-processing step to
> enhance image quality for the detector. However, the functional mismatch
> between restoration and detection networks can introduce instability and hinder
> effective integration -- an issue that remains underexplored. We revisit this
> limitation through the lens of Lipschitz continuity, analyzing the functional
> differences between restoration and detection networks in both the input space
> and the parameter space. Our analysis shows that restoration networks perform
> smooth, continuous transformations, while object detectors operate with
> discontinuous decision boundaries, making them highly sensitive to minor
> perturbations. This mismatch introduces instability in traditional cascade
> frameworks, where even imperceptible noise from restoration is amplified during
> detection, disrupting gradient flow and hindering optimization. To address
> this, we propose Lipschitz-regularized object detection (LROD), a simple yet
> effective framework that integrates image restoration directly into the
> detector's feature learning, harmonizing the Lipschitz continuity of both tasks
> during training. We implement this framework as Lipschitz-regularized YOLO
> (LR-YOLO), extending seamlessly to existing YOLO detectors. Extensive
> experiments on haze and low-light benchmarks demonstrate that LR-YOLO
> consistently improves detection stability, optimization smoothness, and overall
> accuracy.
