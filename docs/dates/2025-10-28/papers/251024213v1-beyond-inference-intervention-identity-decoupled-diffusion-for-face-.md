## 摘要（原文）

> Face anonymization aims to conceal identity information while preserving
> non-identity attributes. Mainstream diffusion models rely on inference-time
> interventions such as negative guidance or energy-based optimization, which are
> applied post-training to suppress identity features. These interventions often
> introduce distribution shifts and entangle identity with non-identity
> attributes, degrading visual fidelity and data utility. To address this, we
> propose \textbf{ID\textsuperscript{2}Face}, a training-centric anonymization
> framework that removes the need for inference-time optimization. The rationale
> of our method is to learn a structured latent space where identity and
> non-identity information are explicitly disentangled, enabling direct and
> controllable anonymization at inference. To this end, we design a conditional
> diffusion model with an identity-masked learning scheme. An Identity-Decoupled
> Latent Recomposer uses an Identity Variational Autoencoder to model identity
> features, while non-identity attributes are extracted from same-identity pairs
> and aligned through bidirectional latent alignment. An Identity-Guided Latent
> Harmonizer then fuses these representations via soft-gating conditioned on
> noisy feature prediction. The model is trained with a recomposition-based
> reconstruction loss to enforce disentanglement. At inference, anonymization is
> achieved by sampling a random identity vector from the learned identity space.
> To further suppress identity leakage, we introduce an Orthogonal Identity
> Mapping strategy that enforces orthogonality between sampled and source
> identity vectors. Experiments demonstrate that ID\textsuperscript{2}Face
> outperforms existing methods in visual quality, identity suppression, and
> utility preservation.
