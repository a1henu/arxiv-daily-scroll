## 摘要（原文）

> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that large-scale pretraining
> enables systems to adapt rapidly to new problems with little supervision in the
> language domain. This success, however, has not translated as effectively to
> the visual domain, where models, including LLMs, continue to struggle with
> compositional understanding, sample efficiency, and general-purpose
> problem-solving. We investigate Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) as a promising
> direction for bridging this gap. Pretraining on spatiotemporal data endows
> these models with strong inductive biases for structure and dynamics, which we
> hypothesize can support broad task adaptability. To test this, we design a
> controlled evaluation in which both a pretrained LLM and a pretrained VDM are
> equipped with lightweight adapters and presented with tasks in their natural
> modalities. Across benchmarks including ARC-AGI, ConceptARC, visual games,
> route planning, and cellular automata, VDMs demonstrate higher data efficiency
> than their language counterparts. Taken together, our results indicate that
> video pretraining offers inductive biases that support progress toward visual
> foundation models.
