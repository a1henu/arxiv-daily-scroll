## 摘要（原文）

> The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the creation of highly
> realistic forged facial images, posing significant threats to AI security,
> digital media integrity, and public trust. Face forgery techniques, ranging
> from face swapping and attribute editing to powerful diffusion-based image
> synthesis, are increasingly being used for malicious purposes such as
> misinformation, identity fraud, and defamation. This growing challenge
> underscores the urgent need for robust and generalizable face forgery detection
> methods as a critical component of AI security infrastructure. In this work, we
> propose a novel dual-branch convolutional neural network for face forgery
> detection that leverages complementary cues from both spatial and frequency
> domains. The RGB branch captures semantic information, while the frequency
> branch focuses on high-frequency artifacts that are difficult for generative
> models to suppress. A channel attention module is introduced to adaptively fuse
> these heterogeneous features, highlighting the most informative channels for
> forgery discrimination. To guide the network's learning process, we design a
> unified loss function, FSC Loss, that combines focal loss, supervised
> contrastive loss, and a frequency center margin loss to enhance class
> separability and robustness. We evaluate our model on the DiFF benchmark, which
> includes forged images generated from four representative methods:
> text-to-image, image-to-image, face swap, and face edit. Our method achieves
> strong performance across all categories and outperforms average human
> accuracy. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness and its potential
> contribution to safeguarding AI ecosystems against visual forgery attacks.
