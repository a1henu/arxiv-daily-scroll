## 摘要（原文）

> The visual representation of a pre-trained model prioritizes the
> classifiability on downstream tasks, while the widespread applications for
> pre-trained visual models have posed new requirements for representation
> interpretability. However, it remains unclear whether the pre-trained
> representations can achieve high interpretability and classifiability
> simultaneously. To answer this question, we quantify the representation
> interpretability by leveraging its correlation with the ratio of interpretable
> semantics within the representations. Given the pre-trained representations,
> only the interpretable semantics can be captured by interpretations, whereas
> the uninterpretable part leads to information loss. Based on this fact, we
> propose the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) that evaluates the
> information loss, measures the ratio of interpretable semantics, and quantifies
> the representation interpretability. In the evaluation of the representation
> interpretability with different classifiability, we surprisingly discover that
> the interpretability and classifiability are positively correlated, i.e.,
> representations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable
> semantics that can be captured in the interpretations. This observation further
> supports two benefits to the pre-trained representations. First, the
> classifiability of representations can be further improved by fine-tuning with
> interpretability maximization. Second, with the classifiability improvement for
> the representations, we obtain predictions based on their interpretations with
> less accuracy degradation. The discovered positive correlation and
> corresponding applications show that practitioners can unify the improvements
> in interpretability and classifiability for pre-trained vision models. Codes
> are available at https://github.com/ssfgunner/IIS.
