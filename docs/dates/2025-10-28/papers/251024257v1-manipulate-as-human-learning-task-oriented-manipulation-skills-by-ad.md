## 摘要（原文）

> In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing robots and
> autonomous systems that can interact with human in a more natural and intuitive
> way. One of the key challenges in achieving this goal is to enable these
> systems to manipulate objects and tools in a manner that is similar to that of
> humans. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning human-style
> manipulation skills by using adversarial motion priors, which we name HMAMP.
> The approach leverages adversarial networks to model the complex dynamics of
> tool and object manipulation, as well as the aim of the manipulation task. The
> discriminator is trained using a combination of real-world data and simulation
> data executed by the agent, which is designed to train a policy that generates
> realistic motion trajectories that match the statistical properties of human
> motion. We evaluated HMAMP on one challenging manipulation task: hammering, and
> the results indicate that HMAMP is capable of learning human-style manipulation
> skills that outperform current baseline methods. Additionally, we demonstrate
> that HMAMP has potential for real-world applications by performing real robot
> arm hammering tasks. In general, HMAMP represents a significant step towards
> developing robots and autonomous systems that can interact with humans in a
> more natural and intuitive way, by learning to manipulate tools and objects in
> a manner similar to how humans do.
