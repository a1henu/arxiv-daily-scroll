**关键词**：脑信号解码, 跨被试适应, 视频重建, 多编码器框架, Top-K协作

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：跨被试脑信号视频重建数据稀缺，现有方法忽略被试特异性信息，适应慢
- 方法要点：设计N个特定编码器提取被试特异性信息，共享编码器提取不变信息，Top-K模块协作增强解码
- 实验或效果：在fMRI/EEG基准上验证，仅需一个模型实现高效跨被试解码与新被试快速适应

## 摘要（原文）

> Reconstructing video from brain signals is an important brain decoding task. Existing brain decoding frameworks are primarily built on a subject-dependent paradigm, which requires large amounts of brain data for each subject. However, the expensive cost of collecting brain-video data causes severe data scarcity. Although some cross-subject methods being introduced, they often overfocus with subject-invariant information while neglecting subject-specific information, resulting in slow fine-tune-based adaptation strategy. To achieve fast and data-efficient new subject adaptation, we propose MindCross, a novel cross-subject framework. MindCross's N specific encoders and one shared encoder are designed to extract subject-specific and subject-invariant information, respectively. Additionally, a Top-K collaboration module is adopted to enhance new subject decoding with the knowledge learned from previous subjects' encoders. Extensive experiments on fMRI/EEG-to-video benchmarks demonstrate MindCross's efficacy and efficiency of cross-subject decoding and new subject adaptation using only one model.
