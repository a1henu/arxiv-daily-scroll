## 摘要（原文）

> A novel approach for the fast onboard detection of isolated markers for
> visual relative localisation of multiple teammates in agile UAV swarms is
> introduced in this paper. As the detection forms a key component of real-time
> localisation systems, a three-fold innovation is presented, consisting of an
> optimised procedure for CPUs, a GPU shader program, and a functionally
> equivalent FPGA streaming architecture. For the proposed CPU and GPU solutions,
> the mean processing time per pixel of input camera frames was accelerated by
> two to three orders of magnitude compared to the state of the art. For the
> localisation task, the proposed FPGA architecture offered the most significant
> overall acceleration by minimising the total delay from camera exposure to
> detection results. Additionally, the proposed solutions were evaluated on
> various 32-bit and 64-bit embedded platforms to demonstrate their efficiency,
> as well as their feasibility for applications using low-end UAVs and MAVs.
> Thus, it has become a crucial enabling technology for agile UAV swarming.
