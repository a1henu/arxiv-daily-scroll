**一句话要点**：提出XBench基准以评估胸片视觉语言模型的跨模态可解释性

**关键词**：视觉语言模型, 医学图像解释, 胸片基准, 跨模态定位, 可解释性评估

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：视觉语言模型在医学图像中的视觉证据对齐能力不足，影响临床可靠性。
- 方法要点：使用交叉注意力和相似性定位图生成视觉解释，并与放射科医生标注区域对齐评估。
- 实验或效果：发现模型对小病灶定位性能下降，特定数据集预训练可改善对齐，识别与定位能力相关。

## 摘要（原文）

> Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot
> performance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the
> extent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains
> underexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential
> for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first
> systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest
> X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations
> using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and
> quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across
> multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants
> demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies,
> their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2)
> models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved
> alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall
> recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated.
> These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition
> ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the
> need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical
> practice. XBench code is available at
