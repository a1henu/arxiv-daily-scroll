## 摘要（原文）

> Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their
> large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained
> environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation
> Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create
> powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of
> reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables
> smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of
> large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative
> capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is
> an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and
> teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to
> ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both
> reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant
> performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs.
> Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that
> RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and
> closed-source VLMs and, in several instances, surpasses them.
