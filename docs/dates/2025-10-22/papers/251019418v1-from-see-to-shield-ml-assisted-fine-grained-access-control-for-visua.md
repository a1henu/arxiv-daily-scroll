## 摘要（原文）

> As the volume of stored data continues to grow, identifying and protecting
> sensitive information within large repositories becomes increasingly
> challenging, especially when shared with multiple users with different roles
> and permissions. This work presents a system architecture for trusted data
> sharing with policy-driven access control, enabling selective protection of
> sensitive regions while maintaining scalability. The proposed architecture
> integrates four core modules that combine automated detection of sensitive
> regions, post-correction, key management, and access control. Sensitive regions
> are secured using a hybrid scheme that employs symmetric encryption for
> efficiency and Attribute-Based Encryption for policy enforcement. The system
> supports efficient key distribution and isolates key storage to strengthen
> overall security. To demonstrate its applicability, we evaluate the system on
> visual datasets, where Privacy-Sensitive Objects in images are automatically
> detected, reassessed, and selectively encrypted prior to sharing in a data
> repository. Experimental results show that our system provides effective PSO
> detection, increases macro-averaged F1 score (5%) and mean Average Precision
> (10%), and maintains an average policy-enforced decryption time of less than 1
> second per image. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and
> scalability of our proposed solution for fine-grained access control.
