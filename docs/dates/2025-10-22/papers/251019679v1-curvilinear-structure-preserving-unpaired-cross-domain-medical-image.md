## 摘要（原文）

> Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in
> medical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data
> augmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often
> distort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both
> diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is
> consequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological
> changes carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear
> Structure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly
> preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by
> integrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments
> baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological
> supervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We
> integrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones.
> Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence
> tomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography
> demonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves
> state-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned
> mappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear
> structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.
