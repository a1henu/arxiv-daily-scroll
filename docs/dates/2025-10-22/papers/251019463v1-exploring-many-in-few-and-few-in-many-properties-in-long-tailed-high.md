## 摘要（原文）

> Despite significant advancements in deep classification techniques and in-lab
> automatic optical inspection models for long-tailed or highly imbalanced data,
> applying these approaches to real-world IC defect classification tasks remains
> challenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world
> conditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result
> in data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general
> public imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open
> imbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.
> Second, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and
> class-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant
> difficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced
> datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14
> dataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI
> systems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is
> characterized by its unique "intra-class clusters" property, which presents two
> major challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.
> These characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,
> significantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers
> for highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net,
> which follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional
> channel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining
> strategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental
> evaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art
> models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and
> competitiveness on general public datasets.
