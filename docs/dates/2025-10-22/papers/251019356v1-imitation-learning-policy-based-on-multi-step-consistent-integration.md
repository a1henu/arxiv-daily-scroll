## 摘要（原文）

> The wide application of flow-matching methods has greatly promoted the
> development of robot imitation learning. However, these methods all face the
> problem of high inference time. To address this issue, researchers have
> proposed distillation methods and consistency methods, but the performance of
> these methods still struggles to compete with that of the original diffusion
> models and flow-matching models. In this article, we propose a one-step
> shortcut method with multi-step integration for robot imitation learning. To
> balance the inference speed and performance, we extend the multi-step
> consistency loss on the basis of the shortcut model, split the one-step loss
> into multi-step losses, and improve the performance of one-step inference.
> Secondly, to solve the problem of unstable optimization of the multi-step loss
> and the original flow-matching loss, we propose an adaptive gradient allocation
> method to enhance the stability of the learning process. Finally, we evaluate
> the proposed method in two simulation benchmarks and five real-world
> environment tasks. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the
> proposed algorithm.
