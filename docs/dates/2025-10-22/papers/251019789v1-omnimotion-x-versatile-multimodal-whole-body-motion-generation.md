## 摘要（原文）

> This paper introduces OmniMotion-X, a versatile multimodal framework for
> whole-body human motion generation, leveraging an autoregressive diffusion
> transformer in a unified sequence-to-sequence manner. OmniMotion-X efficiently
> supports diverse multimodal tasks, including text-to-motion, music-to-dance,
> speech-to-gesture, and global spatial-temporal control scenarios (e.g., motion
> prediction, in-betweening, completion, and joint/trajectory-guided synthesis),
> as well as flexible combinations of these tasks. Specifically, we propose the
> use of reference motion as a novel conditioning signal, substantially enhancing
> the consistency of generated content, style, and temporal dynamics crucial for
> realistic animations. To handle multimodal conflicts, we introduce a
> progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy. To enable
> high-quality multimodal training, we construct OmniMoCap-X, the largest unified
> multimodal motion dataset to date, integrating 28 publicly available MoCap
> sources across 10 distinct tasks, standardized to the SMPL-X format at 30 fps.
> To ensure detailed and consistent annotations, we render sequences into videos
> and use GPT-4o to automatically generate structured and hierarchical captions,
> capturing both low-level actions and high-level semantics. Extensive
> experimental evaluations confirm that OmniMotion-X significantly surpasses
> existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple
> multimodal tasks and enabling the interactive generation of realistic,
> coherent, and controllable long-duration motions.
