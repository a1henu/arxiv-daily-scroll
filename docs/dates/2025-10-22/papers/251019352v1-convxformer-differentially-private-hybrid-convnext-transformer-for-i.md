## 摘要（原文）

> Data-driven inertial sequence learning has revolutionized navigation in
> GPS-denied environments, offering superior odometric resolution compared to
> traditional Bayesian methods. However, deep learning-based inertial tracking
> systems remain vulnerable to privacy breaches that can expose sensitive
> training data. \hl{Existing differential privacy solutions often compromise
> model performance by introducing excessive noise, particularly in
> high-frequency inertial measurements.} In this article, we propose ConvXformer,
> a hybrid architecture that fuses ConvNeXt blocks with Transformer encoders in a
> hierarchical structure for robust inertial navigation. We propose an efficient
> differential privacy mechanism incorporating adaptive gradient clipping and
> gradient-aligned noise injection (GANI) to protect sensitive information while
> ensuring model performance. Our framework leverages truncated singular value
> decomposition for gradient processing, enabling precise control over the
> privacy-utility trade-off. Comprehensive performance evaluations on benchmark
> datasets (OxIOD, RIDI, RoNIN) demonstrate that ConvXformer surpasses
> state-of-the-art methods, achieving more than 40% improvement in positioning
> accuracy while ensuring $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy guarantees. To
> validate real-world performance, we introduce the Mech-IO dataset, collected
> from the mechanical engineering building at KAIST, where intense magnetic
> fields from industrial equipment induce significant sensor perturbations. This
> demonstrated robustness under severe environmental distortions makes our
> framework well-suited for secure and intelligent navigation in cyber-physical
> systems.
