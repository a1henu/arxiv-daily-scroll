## 摘要（原文）

> RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial
> resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a
> high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can
> substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as
> high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference.
> However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two
> modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering
> effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose
> {Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge
> distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal
> asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that
> minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's
> computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments
> demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and
> comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity
> of each designed component. The code will be released soon.
