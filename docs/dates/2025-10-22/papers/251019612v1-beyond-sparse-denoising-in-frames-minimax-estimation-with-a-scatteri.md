## 摘要（原文）

> A considerable amount of research in harmonic analysis has been devoted to
> non-linear estimators of signals contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. They
> are implemented by thresholding coefficients in a frame, which provide a sparse
> signal representation, or by minimising their $\ell^1$ norm. However, sparse
> estimators in frames are not sufficiently rich to adapt to complex signal
> regularities. For cartoon images whose edges are piecewise $\bf C^\alpha$
> curves, wavelet, curvelet and Xlet frames are suboptimal if the Lipschitz
> exponent $\alpha \leq 2$ is an unknown parameter. Deep convolutional neural
> networks have recently obtained much better numerical results, which reach the
> minimax asymptotic bounds for all $\alpha$. Wavelet scattering coefficients
> have been introduced as simplified convolutional neural network models. They
> are computed by transforming the modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second
> wavelet transform. We introduce a denoising estimator by jointly minimising and
> maximising the $\ell^1$ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients.
> We prove that these $\ell^1$ norms capture different types of geometric image
> regularity. Numerical experiments show that this denoising estimator reaches
> the minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents
> $\alpha \leq 2$. We state this numerical result as a mathematical conjecture.
> It provides a different harmonic analysis approach to suppress noise from
> signals, and to specify the geometric regularity of functions. It also opens a
> mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and denoising estimators with
> deep convolutional network.
