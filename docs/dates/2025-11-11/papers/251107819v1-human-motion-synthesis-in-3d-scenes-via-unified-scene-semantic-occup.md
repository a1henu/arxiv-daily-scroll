## 摘要（原文）

> Human motion synthesis in 3D scenes relies heavily on scene comprehension, while current methods focus mainly on scene structure but ignore the semantic understanding. In this paper, we propose a human motion synthesis framework that take an unified Scene Semantic Occupancy (SSO) for scene representation, termed SSOMotion. We design a bi-directional tri-plane decomposition to derive a compact version of the SSO, and scene semantics are mapped to an unified feature space via CLIP encoding and shared linear dimensionality reduction. Such strategy can derive the fine-grained scene semantic structures while significantly reduce redundant computations. We further take these scene hints and movement direction derived from instructions for motion control via frame-wise scene query. Extensive experiments and ablation studies conducted on cluttered scenes using ShapeNet furniture, as well as scanned scenes from PROX and Replica datasets, demonstrate its cutting-edge performance while validating its effectiveness and generalization ability. Code will be publicly available at https://github.com/jingyugong/SSOMotion.
