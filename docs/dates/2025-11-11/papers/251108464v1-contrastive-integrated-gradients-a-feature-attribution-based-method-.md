**关键词**：全切片图像分析, 特征归因方法, 对比集成梯度, 可解释性, 计算病理学, 弱监督学习

## 3 点简述
- 全切片图像分析中，现有归因方法可能忽略类间判别信号，影响肿瘤亚型区分。
- CIG在logit空间计算对比梯度，突出类判别区域，满足集成归因公理。
- 在多个癌症数据集上验证，CIG提供更信息化的归因，定量和定性评估均优于基线。

## 摘要（原文）

> Interpretability is essential in Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis for computational pathology, where understanding model predictions helps build trust in AI-assisted diagnostics. While Integrated Gradients (IG) and related attribution methods have shown promise, applying them directly to WSIs introduces challenges due to their high-resolution nature. These methods capture model decision patterns but may overlook class-discriminative signals that are crucial for distinguishing between tumor subtypes. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Integrated Gradients (CIG), a novel attribution method that enhances interpretability by computing contrastive gradients in logit space. First, CIG highlights class-discriminative regions by comparing feature importance relative to a reference class, offering sharper differentiation between tumor and non-tumor areas. Second, CIG satisfies the axioms of integrated attribution, ensuring consistency and theoretical soundness. Third, we propose two attribution quality metrics, MIL-AIC and MIL-SIC, which measure how predictive information and model confidence evolve with access to salient regions, particularly under weak supervision. We validate CIG across three datasets spanning distinct cancer types: CAMELYON16 (breast cancer metastasis in lymph nodes), TCGA-RCC (renal cell carcinoma), and TCGA-Lung (lung cancer). Experimental results demonstrate that CIG yields more informative attributions both quantitatively, using MIL-AIC and MIL-SIC, and qualitatively, through visualizations that align closely with ground truth tumor regions, underscoring its potential for interpretable and trustworthy WSI-based diagnostics
