## 摘要（原文）

> Autonomous systems increasingly rely on human feedback to align their behavior, expressed as pairwise comparisons, rankings, or demonstrations. While existing methods can adapt behaviors, they often fail to guarantee safety in safety-critical domains. We propose a safety-guaranteed, optimal, and efficient approach to solve the learning problem from preferences, rankings, or demonstrations using Weighted Signal Temporal Logic (WSTL). WSTL learning problems, when implemented naively, lead to multi-linear constraints in the weights to be learned. By introducing structural pruning and log-transform procedures, we reduce the problem size and recast the problem as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program while preserving safety guarantees. Experiments on robotic navigation and real-world Formula 1 data demonstrate that the method effectively captures nuanced preferences and models complex task objectives.
