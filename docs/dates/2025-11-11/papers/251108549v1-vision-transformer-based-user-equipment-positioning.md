**关键词**：用户设备定位, 视觉变换器, 信道状态信息, 角度延迟配置文件, 深度学习, 定位误差

## 3 点简述
- 现有深度学习模型对输入数据分配相同注意力，且不适用于非序列数据如瞬时信道状态信息。
- 采用注意力机制的视觉变换器架构，聚焦信道状态信息矩阵中的角度延迟配置文件。
- 在DeepMIMO和ViWi数据集上验证，室内外定位误差显著降低，优于现有方法约38%。

## 摘要（原文）

> Recently, Deep Learning (DL) techniques have been used for User Equipment (UE) positioning. However, the key shortcomings of such models is that: i) they weigh the same attention to the entire input; ii) they are not well suited for the non-sequential data e.g., when only instantaneous Channel State Information (CSI) is available. In this context, we propose an attention-based Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture that focuses on the Angle Delay Profile (ADP) from CSI matrix. Our approach, validated on the `DeepMIMO' and `ViWi' ray-tracing datasets, achieves an Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.55m indoors, 13.59m outdoors in DeepMIMO, and 3.45m in ViWi's outdoor blockage scenario. The proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art schemes by $\sim$ 38\%. It also performs substantially better than other approaches that we have considered in terms of the distribution of error distance.
