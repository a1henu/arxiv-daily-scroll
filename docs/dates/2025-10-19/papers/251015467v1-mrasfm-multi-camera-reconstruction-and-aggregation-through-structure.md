## 摘要（原文）

> Structure from Motion (SfM) estimates camera poses and reconstructs point
> clouds, forming a foundation for various tasks. However, applying SfM to
> driving scenes captured by multi-camera systems presents significant
> difficulties, including unreliable pose estimation, excessive outliers in road
> surface reconstruction, and low reconstruction efficiency. To address these
> limitations, we propose a Multi-camera Reconstruction and Aggregation
> Structure-from-Motion (MRASfM) framework specifically designed for driving
> scenes. MRASfM enhances the reliability of camera pose estimation by leveraging
> the fixed spatial relationships within the multi-camera system during the
> registration process. To improve the quality of road surface reconstruction,
> our framework employs a plane model to effectively remove erroneous points from
> the triangulated road surface. Moreover, treating the multi-camera set as a
> single unit in Bundle Adjustment (BA) helps reduce optimization variables to
> boost efficiency. In addition, MRASfM achieves multi-scene aggregation through
> scene association and assembly modules in a coarse-to-fine fashion. We deployed
> multi-camera systems on actual vehicles to validate the generalizability of
> MRASfM across various scenes and its robustness in challenging conditions
> through real-world applications. Furthermore, large-scale validation results on
> public datasets show the state-of-the-art performance of MRASfM, achieving
> 0.124 absolute pose error on the nuScenes dataset.
