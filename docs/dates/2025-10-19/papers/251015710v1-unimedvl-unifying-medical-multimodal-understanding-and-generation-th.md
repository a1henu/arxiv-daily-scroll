## 摘要（原文）

> Medical diagnostic applications require models that can process multimodal
> medical inputs (images, patient histories, lab results) and generate diverse
> outputs including both textual reports and visual content (annotations,
> segmentation masks, and images). Despite this need, existing medical AI systems
> disrupt this unified process: medical image understanding models interpret
> images but cannot generate visual outputs, while medical image generation
> models synthesize images but cannot provide textual explanations. This leads to
> gaps in data representation, feature integration, and task-level multimodal
> capabilities. To this end, we propose a multi-level framework that draws
> inspiration from diagnostic workflows through the
> Observation-Knowledge-Analysis (OKA) paradigm. Specifically, at the observation
> level, we construct UniMed-5M, a dataset comprising over 5.6M samples that
> reformat diverse unimodal data into multimodal pairs for foundational
> observation. At the knowledge level, we propose Progressive Curriculum Learning
> that systematically introduces medical multimodal knowledge. At the analysis
> level, we introduce UniMedVL, the first medical unified multimodal model for
> the simultaneous analysis of image understanding and generation tasks within a
> single architecture. UniMedVL achieves superior performance on five medical
> image understanding benchmarks, while matching specialized models in generation
> quality across eight medical imaging modalities. Crucially, our unified
> architecture enables bidirectional knowledge sharing: generation tasks enhance
> visual understanding features, demonstrating that integrating traditionally
> separate capabilities within a single medical framework unlocks improvements
> across diverse medical vision-language tasks. Code is available at
> https://github.com/uni-medical/UniMedVL.
