## 摘要（原文）

> This paper presents ClapperText, a benchmark dataset for handwritten and
> printed text recognition in visually degraded and low-resource settings. The
> dataset is derived from 127 World War II-era archival video segments containing
> clapperboards that record structured production metadata such as date,
> location, and camera-operator identity. ClapperText includes 9,813 annotated
> frames and 94,573 word-level text instances, 67% of which are handwritten and
> 1,566 are partially occluded. Each instance includes transcription, semantic
> category, text type, and occlusion status, with annotations available as
> rotated bounding boxes represented as 4-point polygons to support spatially
> precise OCR applications. Recognizing clapperboard text poses significant
> challenges, including motion blur, handwriting variation, exposure
> fluctuations, and cluttered backgrounds, mirroring broader challenges in
> historical document analysis where structured content appears in degraded,
> non-standard forms. We provide both full-frame annotations and cropped word
> images to support downstream tasks. Using a consistent per-video evaluation
> protocol, we benchmark six representative recognition and seven detection
> models under zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Despite the small training
> set (18 videos), fine-tuning leads to substantial performance gains,
> highlighting ClapperText's suitability for few-shot learning scenarios. The
> dataset offers a realistic and culturally grounded resource for advancing
> robust OCR and document understanding in low-resource archival contexts. The
> dataset and evaluation code are available at
> https://github.com/linty5/ClapperText.
