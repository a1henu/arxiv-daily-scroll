## 摘要（原文）

> Traditionally, prediction and planning in autonomous driving (AD) have been
> treated as separate, sequential modules. Recently, there has been a growing
> shift towards tighter integration of these components, known as Integrated
> Prediction and Planning (IPP), with the aim of enabling more informed and
> adaptive decision-making. However, it remains unclear to what extent this
> integration actually improves planning performance. In this work, we
> investigate the role of prediction in IPP approaches, drawing on the widely
> adopted Val14 benchmark, which encompasses more common driving scenarios with
> relatively low interaction complexity, and the interPlan benchmark, which
> includes highly interactive and out-of-distribution driving situations. Our
> analysis reveals that even access to perfect future predictions does not lead
> to better planning outcomes, indicating that current IPP methods often fail to
> fully exploit future behavior information. Instead, we focus on high-quality
> proposal generation, while using predictions primarily for collision checks. We
> find that many imitation learning-based planners struggle to generate realistic
> and plausible proposals, performing worse than PDM - a simple lane-following
> approach. Motivated by this observation, we build on PDM with an enhanced
> proposal generation method, shifting the emphasis towards producing diverse but
> realistic and high-quality proposals. This proposal-centric approach
> significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in out-of-distribution
> and highly interactive settings, where it sets new state-of-the-art results.
