## 摘要（原文）

> DeepFake technology has advanced significantly in recent years, enabling the
> creation of highly realistic synthetic face images. Existing DeepFake detection
> methods often struggle with pose variations, occlusions, and artifacts that are
> difficult to detect in real-world conditions. To address these challenges, we
> propose a multi-view architecture that enhances DeepFake detection by analyzing
> facial features at multiple levels. Our approach integrates three specialized
> encoders, a global view encoder for detecting boundary inconsistencies, a
> middle view encoder for analyzing texture and color alignment, and a local view
> encoder for capturing distortions in expressive facial regions such as the
> eyes, nose, and mouth, where DeepFake artifacts frequently occur. Additionally,
> we incorporate a face orientation encoder, trained to classify face poses,
> ensuring robust detection across various viewing angles. By fusing features
> from these encoders, our model achieves superior performance in detecting
> manipulated images, even under challenging pose and lighting
> conditions.Experimental results on challenging datasets demonstrate the
> effectiveness of our method, outperforming conventional single-view approaches
