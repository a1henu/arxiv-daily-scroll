## 摘要（原文）

> Classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocorticogram (ECoG)
> signals obtained during motor imagery (MI) has substantial application
> potential, including for communication assistance and rehabilitation support
> for patients with motor impairments. These signals remain inherently
> susceptible to physiological artifacts (e.g., eye blinking, swallowing), which
> pose persistent challenges. Although Transformer-based approaches for
> classifying EEG and ECoG signals have been widely adopted, they often struggle
> to capture fine-grained dependencies within them. To overcome these
> limitations, we propose Cortical-SSM, a novel architecture that extends deep
> state space models to capture integrated dependencies of EEG and ECoG signals
> across temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. We validated our method across
> three benchmarks: 1) two large-scale public MI EEG datasets containing more
> than 50 subjects, and 2) a clinical MI ECoG dataset recorded from a patient
> with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our method outperformed baseline methods on
> the three benchmarks. Furthermore, visual explanations derived from our model
> indicate that it effectively captures neurophysiologically relevant regions of
> both EEG and ECoG signals.
