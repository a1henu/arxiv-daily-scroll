## 摘要（原文）

> Instruction-based video editing promises to democratize content creation, yet
> its progress is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality
> training data. We introduce Ditto, a holistic framework designed to tackle this
> fundamental challenge. At its heart, Ditto features a novel data generation
> pipeline that fuses the creative diversity of a leading image editor with an
> in-context video generator, overcoming the limited scope of existing models. To
> make this process viable, our framework resolves the prohibitive cost-quality
> trade-off by employing an efficient, distilled model architecture augmented by
> a temporal enhancer, which simultaneously reduces computational overhead and
> improves temporal coherence. Finally, to achieve full scalability, this entire
> pipeline is driven by an intelligent agent that crafts diverse instructions and
> rigorously filters the output, ensuring quality control at scale. Using this
> framework, we invested over 12,000 GPU-days to build Ditto-1M, a new dataset of
> one million high-fidelity video editing examples. We trained our model, Editto,
> on Ditto-1M with a curriculum learning strategy. The results demonstrate
> superior instruction-following ability and establish a new state-of-the-art in
> instruction-based video editing.
