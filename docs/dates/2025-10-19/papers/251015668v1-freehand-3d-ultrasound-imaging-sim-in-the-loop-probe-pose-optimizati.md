## 摘要（原文）

> Freehand 3D ultrasound (US) imaging using conventional 2D probes offers
> flexibility and accessibility for diverse clinical applications but faces
> challenges in accurate probe pose estimation. Traditional methods depend on
> costly tracking systems, while neural network-based methods struggle with image
> noise and error accumulation, compromising reconstruction precision. We propose
> a cost-effective and versatile solution that leverages lightweight cameras and
> visual servoing in simulated environments for precise 3D US imaging. These
> cameras capture visual feedback from a textured planar workspace. To counter
> occlusions and lighting issues, we introduce an image restoration method that
> reconstructs occluded regions by matching surrounding texture patterns. For
> pose estimation, we develop a simulation-in-the-loop approach, which replicates
> the system setup in simulation and iteratively minimizes pose errors between
> simulated and real-world observations. A visual servoing controller refines the
> alignment of camera views, improving translational estimation by optimizing
> image alignment. Validations on a soft vascular phantom, a 3D-printed conical
> model, and a human arm demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our approach,
> with Hausdorff distances to the reference reconstructions of 0.359 mm, 1.171
> mm, and 0.858 mm, respectively. These results confirm the method's potential
> for reliable freehand 3D US reconstruction.
