## 摘要（原文）

> Rendering novel, relit views of a human head, given a monocular portrait
> image as input, is an inherently underconstrained problem. The traditional
> graphics solution is to explicitly decompose the input image into geometry,
> material and lighting via differentiable rendering; but this is constrained by
> the multiple assumptions and approximations of the underlying models and
> parameterizations of these scene components. We propose 3DPR, an image-based
> relighting model that leverages generative priors learnt from multi-view
> One-Light-at-A-Time (OLAT) images captured in a light stage. We introduce a new
> diverse and large-scale multi-view 4K OLAT dataset of 139 subjects to learn a
> high-quality prior over the distribution of high-frequency face reflectance. We
> leverage the latent space of a pre-trained generative head model that provides
> a rich prior over face geometry learnt from in-the-wild image datasets. The
> input portrait is first embedded in the latent manifold of such a model through
> an encoder-based inversion process. Then a novel triplane-based reflectance
> network trained on our lightstage data is used to synthesize high-fidelity OLAT
> images to enable image-based relighting. Our reflectance network operates in
> the latent space of the generative head model, crucially enabling a relatively
> small number of lightstage images to train the reflectance model. Combining the
> generated OLATs according to a given HDRI environment maps yields physically
> accurate environmental relighting results. Through quantitative and qualitative
> evaluations, we demonstrate that 3DPR outperforms previous methods,
> particularly in preserving identity and in capturing lighting effects such as
> specularities, self-shadows, and subsurface scattering. Project Page:
