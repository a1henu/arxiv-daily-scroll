## 摘要（原文）

> Current self-supervised denoising techniques achieve impressive results, yet
> their real-world application is frequently constrained by substantial
> computational and memory demands, necessitating a compromise between inference
> speed and reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present an
> ultra-lightweight model that addresses this challenge, achieving both fast
> denoising and high quality image restoration. Built upon the Noise2Noise
> training framework-which removes the reliance on clean reference images or
> explicit noise modeling-we introduce an innovative multistage denoising
> pipeline named Noise2Detail (N2D). During inference, this approach disrupts the
> spatial correlations of noise patterns to produce intermediate smooth
> structures, which are subsequently refined to recapture fine details directly
> from the noisy input. Extensive testing reveals that Noise2Detail surpasses
> existing dataset-free techniques in performance, while requiring only a
> fraction of the computational resources. This combination of efficiency, low
> computational cost, and data-free approach make it a valuable tool for
> biomedical imaging, overcoming the challenges of scarce clean training data-due
> to rare and complex imaging modalities-while enabling fast inference for
> practical use.
