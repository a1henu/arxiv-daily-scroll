## 摘要（原文）

> 3D phenotyping of plants plays a crucial role for understanding plant growth,
> yield prediction, and disease control. We present a pipeline capable of
> generating high-quality 3D reconstructions of individual agricultural plants.
> To acquire data, a small commercially available UAV captures images of a
> selected plant. Apart from placing ArUco markers, the entire image acquisition
> process is fully autonomous, controlled by a self-developed Android application
> running on the drone's controller. The reconstruction task is particularly
> challenging due to environmental wind and downwash of the UAV. Our proposed
> pipeline supports the integration of arbitrary state-of-the-art 3D
> reconstruction methods. To mitigate errors caused by leaf motion during image
> capture, we use an iterative method that gradually adjusts the input images
> through deformation. Motion is estimated using optical flow between the
> original input images and intermediate 3D reconstructions rendered from the
> corresponding viewpoints. This alignment gradually reduces scene motion,
> resulting in a canonical representation. After a few iterations, our pipeline
> improves the reconstruction of state-of-the-art methods and enables the
> extraction of high-resolution 3D meshes. We will publicly release the source
> code of our reconstruction pipeline. Additionally, we provide a dataset
> consisting of multiple plants from various crops, captured across different
> points in time.
