- 方法要点：通过注入不透明噪声高斯，鼓励表面高斯采用更高不透明度
- 实验或效果：在多个数据集上显著减少虚假透明，保持标准渲染指标竞争力

## 摘要（原文）

> Opaque objects reconstructed by 3DGS often exhibit a falsely transparent
> surface, leading to inconsistent background and internal patterns under camera
> motion in interactive viewing. This issue stems from the ill-posed optimization
> in 3DGS. During training, background and foreground Gaussians are blended via
> alpha-compositing and optimized solely against the input RGB images using a
> photometric loss. As this process lacks an explicit constraint on surface
> opacity, the optimization may incorrectly assign transparency to opaque
> regions, resulting in view-inconsistent and falsely transparent. This issue is
> difficult to detect in standard evaluation settings but becomes particularly
> evident in object-centric reconstructions under interactive viewing. Although
> other causes of view-inconsistency have been explored recently, false
> transparency has not been explicitly identified. To the best of our knowledge,
> we are the first to identify, characterize, and develop solutions for this
> artifact, an underreported artifact in 3DGS. Our strategy, NGS, encourages
> surface Gaussians to adopt higher opacity by injecting opaque noise Gaussians
> in the object volume during training, requiring only minimal modifications to
> the existing splatting process. To quantitatively evaluate false transparency
> in static renderings, we propose a transmittance-based metric that measures the
> severity of this artifact. In addition, we introduce a customized, high-quality
> object-centric scan dataset exhibiting pronounced transparency issues, and we
> augment popular existing datasets with complementary infill noise specifically
> designed to assess the robustness of 3D reconstruction methods to false
> transparency. Experiments across multiple datasets show that NGS substantially
> reduces false transparency while maintaining competitive performance on
> standard rendering metrics, demonstrating its overall effectiveness.
