## 摘要（原文）

> Recognizability, a key perceptual factor in human face processing, strongly
> affects the performance of face recognition (FR) systems in both verification
> and identification tasks. Effectively using recognizability to enhance feature
> representation remains challenging. In deep FR, the loss function plays a
> crucial role in shaping how features are embedded. However, current methods
> have two main drawbacks: (i) recognizability is only partially captured through
> soft margin constraints, resulting in weaker quality representation and lower
> discrimination, especially for low-quality or ambiguous faces; (ii) mutual
> overlapping gradients between feature direction and magnitude introduce
> undesirable interactions during optimization, causing instability and confusion
> in hypersphere planning, which may result in poor generalization, and entangled
> representations where recognizability and identity are not cleanly separated.
> To address these issues, we introduce a hard margin strategy - Quality Control
> Face (QCFace), which overcomes the mutual overlapping gradient problem and
> enables the clear decoupling of recognizability from identity representation.
> Based on this strategy, a novel hard-margin-based loss function employs a
> guidance factor for hypersphere planning, simultaneously optimizing for
> recognition ability and explicit recognizability representation. Extensive
> experiments confirm that QCFace not only provides robust and quantifiable
> recognizability encoding but also achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
> verification and identification benchmarks compared to existing
> recognizability-based losses.
