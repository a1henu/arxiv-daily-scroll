**一句话要点**：提出DPTrack，通过方向性核引导提示学习解决夜间空中跟踪中提示模糊问题

**关键词**：夜间空中跟踪, 提示学习, 方向性核, 拓扑结构, 视觉仿生, 目标跟踪

## 3 点简述
- 现有夜间空中跟踪器仅依赖空间定位监督，导致提示模糊，难以聚焦目标特征
- DPTrack利用拓扑结构编码方向性核，生成精确提示，增强特征表示和定位能力
- 在标准基准测试中表现优异，代码已开源

## 摘要（原文）

> Existing nighttime aerial trackers based on prompt learning rely solely on
> spatial localization supervision, which fails to provide fine-grained cues that
> point to target features and inevitably produces vague prompts. This limitation
> impairs the tracker's ability to accurately focus on the object features and
> results in trackers still performing poorly. To address this issue, we propose
> DPTrack, a prompt-based aerial tracker designed for nighttime scenarios by
> encoding the given object's attribute features into the directional kernel
> enriched with fine-grained cues to generate precise prompts. Specifically,
> drawing inspiration from visual bionics, DPTrack first hierarchically captures
> the object's topological structure, leveraging topological attributes to enrich
> the feature representation. Subsequently, an encoder condenses these
> topology-aware features into the directional kernel, which serves as the core
> guidance signal that explicitly encapsulates the object's fine-grained
> attribute cues. Finally, a kernel-guided prompt module built on
> channel-category correspondence attributes propagates the kernel across the
> features of the search region to pinpoint the positions of target features and
> convert them into precise prompts, integrating spatial gating for robust
> nighttime tracking. Extensive evaluations on established benchmarks demonstrate
> DPTrack's superior performance. Our code will be available at
