## 摘要（原文）

> This paper presents a novel dataset aimed at detecting pedestrians'
> intentions as they approach an ego-vehicle. The dataset comprises synchronized
> multi-modal data, including fisheye camera feeds, lidar laser scans, ultrasonic
> sensor readings, and motion capture-based 3D body poses, collected across
> diverse real-world scenarios. Key contributions include detailed annotations of
> 3D body joint positions synchronized with fisheye camera images, as well as
> accurate 3D pedestrian positions extracted from lidar data, facilitating robust
> benchmarking for perception algorithms. We release a portion of the dataset
> along with a comprehensive benchmark suite, featuring evaluation metrics for
> accuracy, efficiency, and scalability on embedded systems. By addressing
> real-world challenges such as sensor occlusions, dynamic environments, and
> hardware constraints, this dataset offers a unique resource for developing and
> evaluating state-of-the-art algorithms in pedestrian detection, 3D pose
> estimation and 4D trajectory and intention prediction. Additionally, we provide
> baseline performance metrics using custom neural network architectures and
> suggest future research directions to encourage the adoption and enhancement of
> the dataset. This work aims to serve as a foundation for researchers seeking to
> advance the capabilities of intelligent vehicles in near-field scenarios.
