## 摘要（原文）

> Registering an object shape to a sequence of point clouds undergoing
> non-rigid deformation is a long-standing challenge. The key difficulties stem
> from two factors: (i) the presence of local minima due to the non-convexity of
> registration objectives, especially under noisy or partial inputs, which
> hinders accurate and robust deformation estimation, and (ii) error accumulation
> over long sequences, leading to tracking failures. To address these challenges,
> we introduce to adopt a scalable data-driven approach and propose ERNet, an
> efficient feed-forward model trained on large deformation datasets. It is
> designed to handle noisy and partial inputs while effectively leveraging
> temporal information for accurate and consistent sequential registration. The
> key to our design is predicting a sequence of deformation graphs through a
> two-stage pipeline, which first estimates frame-wise coarse graph nodes for
> robust initialization, before refining their trajectories over time in a
> sliding-window fashion. Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach
> (i) outperforms previous state-of-the-art on both the DeformingThings4D and
> D-FAUST datasets, and (ii) achieves more than 4x speedup compared to the
> previous best, offering significant efficiency improvement.
