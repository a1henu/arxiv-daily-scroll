**一句话要点**：提出CARDIUM数据集与多模态Transformer架构，以提升产前先天性心脏病检测性能。

**关键词**：先天性心脏病检测, 多模态数据集, Transformer架构, 跨注意力机制, 产前诊断, 医学影像分析

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：产前先天性心脏病诊断数据稀缺、不平衡，且缺乏多模态整合。
- 方法要点：构建首个公开多模态数据集，融合超声图像与临床记录，采用跨注意力机制融合特征。
- 实验或效果：在CARDIUM数据集上，多模态方法比单模态提升11%和50%，F1得分达79.8±4.8%。

## 摘要（原文）

> Prenatal diagnosis of Congenital Heart Diseases (CHDs) holds great potential
> for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven solutions. However, collecting
> high-quality diagnostic data remains difficult due to the rarity of these
> conditions, resulting in imbalanced and low-quality datasets that hinder model
> performance. Moreover, no public efforts have been made to integrate multiple
> sources of information, such as imaging and clinical data, further limiting the
> ability of AI models to support and enhance clinical decision-making. To
> overcome these challenges, we introduce the Congenital Anomaly Recognition with
> Diagnostic Images and Unified Medical records (CARDIUM) dataset, the first
> publicly available multimodal dataset consolidating fetal ultrasound and
> echocardiographic images along with maternal clinical records for prenatal CHD
> detection. Furthermore, we propose a robust multimodal transformer architecture
> that incorporates a cross-attention mechanism to fuse feature representations
> from image and tabular data, improving CHD detection by 11% and 50% over image
> and tabular single-modality approaches, respectively, and achieving an F1 score
> of 79.8 $\pm$ 4.8% in the CARDIUM dataset. We will publicly release our dataset
> and code to encourage further research on this unexplored field. Our dataset
> and code are available at https://github.com/BCVUniandes/Cardium, and at the
> project website https://bcv-uniandes.github.io/CardiumPage/
