**关键词**：3D人体重建, 场景几何对齐, 单目视频处理, 运动优化, 虚拟环境交互

## 3 点简述
- 核心问题：现有方法难以在3D空间中准确定位人体，影响虚拟角色与环境的交互。
- 方法要点：通过迭代优化关键帧人体网格与场景点云对齐，并保持非关键帧相对位置一致性。
- 实验或效果：在数据集和野外视频中，SHARE优于现有方法，实现更精确的3D人体放置。

## 摘要（原文）

> Animating realistic character interactions with the surrounding environment
> is important for autonomous agents in gaming, AR/VR, and robotics. However,
> current methods for human motion reconstruction struggle with accurately
> placing humans in 3D space. We introduce Scene-Human Aligned REconstruction
> (SHARE), a technique that leverages the scene geometry's inherent spatial cues
> to accurately ground human motion reconstruction. Each reconstruction relies
> solely on a monocular RGB video from a stationary camera. SHARE first estimates
> a human mesh and segmentation mask for every frame, alongside a scene point map
> at keyframes. It iteratively refines the human's positions at these keyframes
> by comparing the human mesh against the human point map extracted from the
> scene using the mask. Crucially, we also ensure that non-keyframe human meshes
> remain consistent by preserving their relative root joint positions to keyframe
> root joints during optimization. Our approach enables more accurate 3D human
> placement while reconstructing the surrounding scene, facilitating use cases on
> both curated datasets and in-the-wild web videos. Extensive experiments
> demonstrate that SHARE outperforms existing methods.
